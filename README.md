> One of the not-so-obvious side benefits of the miniaturization of electronics is that folks far removed from the realm of electronic engineering become comfortable with small electronic devices and think, “Wouldn’t it be neat if I had a [gizmo] that did…?” Back when computers were called “workstations” their inner workings seemed mysterious, complex, and expensive, and few consumers thought about how they could exploit the computational power. But now that the equivalent of a workstation fits into a hand-sized smartphone complete with a rechargeable power source and a high-definition screen,  software creation is appealing to a non-technical audience. There’s an app for seemingly everything, and even 10-year olds are creating them.
