# THE NODE CHRONICLES
### *Volume 1*


## **PREFACE**



Here's what I'd like for you to do for me:

> Make me laugh. Make me cry. Tell me my place in the world. Lift me out of my skin and place me in another. Show me places I have never visited and carry me to the ends of time and space. Give my demons names and help me confront them. Demonstrate for me possibilities I've never thought of and present me with heroes who will give me courage and hope. Ease my sorrows and increase my joy. Teach me compassion. Entertain and enchant and enlighten me. 

Tell me a story. 


##### FIRST SPLASH PAGE

> Talk is cheap in the 21st century. You either got what it takes or you don't. Only the skilled will survive.

> Welcome to the Node Chronicles. This is a journey into the world of **Electrical Computer Engineering**, the most interesting field known to man. 

---

| Objectives of Opening Words |
| -- |
| Take reader to the very beginning of modern electricity and alternating currents |
| Explain the Field of ECE as it exists today |
| Show examples of what's possible when you master this field |
| Explain or demonstrate how the book is going to work |

> **PANEL ONE** - PULL BACK FROM PREVIOUS IMAGE AND SHOW THE IMAGE OF THE TESLA COIL THROUGH THE CORNEA OF NICOLA TESLAS EYE. NO DIALOGUE.

* **1 CAP:** If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.

> **PANEL TWO** - PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW NICOLA TESLAS FACE, WIDE EYED AS HE JUST WITNESSES WIRELESS ELECTRICITY WORKING FOR THE FIRST TIME

* **2 TESLA:** ...free energy...
* **3 TESLA:** ...it works...

> **PANEL THREE** - PULL BACK EVEN FURTHER TO SHOW THE INFAMOUS TESLA COIL AND SPECTACULAR SHOW OF ELECTRICITY. YOUR CALL ON HOW TESLAS FULL FIGURE FITS INTO THIS PANEL.

* **4 TESLA:** ...this changes everything, again...

> **PANEL FOUR** - A STRONG KNOCK AT THE DOOR, SOMEONE IS THERE TO SHUT TESLA DOWN, AGAIN. HE HAD ALREADY HAD HIS TOWER OF DREAMS AND PATENTS SHUT DOWN AND STOLEN BY JP MORGAN.

* **5 POLICE:** Tesla, open the door, we know you're in there. You were told to cease and desist.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **6 TESLA:** You're making a mistake. JP Morgan has stolen everything from me. 

> **PANEL FIVE** - THE DOOR IS KICKED IN AS A CREW OF POLICE RUSH THE OLD APARTMENT WHERE TESLA HAS BEEN TESTING HIS FREE WIRELESS ENERGY SYSTEM. BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **7 JP MORGAN:** Did you think you could undermine me? 
* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)


> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.


> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.


> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby (BSEE '47) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.

> 1891 - The first electrical laboratory is constructed under the direction of Samuel Wesley Stratton, head of physics. The first courses in electrical engineering are offered here; therefore, 1891 is recognized as the date for establishment of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (originally called the Department of Electrical Engineering).

> 1889 - The Department of Physics is established. Samuel Wesley Stratton, who later becomes president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is placed in charge. Stratton recognizes the potential of electricity and related phenomena and supported that newly developing field of technology. Under his direction, the first electrical laboratory is constructed in 1891, and the first courses in electrical engineering are offered. In 1892, Stratton resigns to accept a position in the Department of Physics at the newly established University of Chicago.

| How well does it explain modern ECE physics? |
| Is the tone tongue-in-cheek or abstract? |
| Do you have other examples from other Universities? |
| Can you clearly explain or diagram the field of ece? |

> One of the not-so-obvious side benefits of the miniaturization of electronics is that folks far removed from the realm of electronic engineering become comfortable with small electronic devices and think, “Wouldn’t it be neat if I had a [gizmo] that did…?” Back when computers were called “workstations” their inner workings seemed mysterious, complex, and expensive, and few consumers thought about how they could exploit the computational power. But now that the equivalent of a workstation fits into a hand-sized smartphone complete with a rechargeable power source and a high-definition screen,  software creation is appealing to a non-technical audience. There’s an app for seemingly everything, and even 10-year olds are creating them.
