# THE NODE CHRONICLES
### *Volume 1*


## **PREFACE**



Here's what I'd like for you to do for me:

> Make me laugh. Make me cry. Tell me my place in the world. Lift me out of my skin and place me in another. Show me places I have never visited and carry me to the ends of time and space. Give my demons names and help me confront them. Demonstrate for me possibilities I've never thought of and present me with heroes who will give me courage and hope. Ease my sorrows and increase my joy. Teach me compassion. Entertain and enchant and enlighten me. 

Tell me a story.

**FIRST SPLASH PAGE**

This is still a work in progress - splash page should act as a second cover for the journey ahead. The intro chapter covers 2 important historical figures and then cuts to modern day, Gou and Non at the BHQ (The Basement Headquarters).

> Talk is cheap in the 21st century. You either got what it takes or you don't. Only the skilled will survive.

**IDEA #1: **Some collage of Tesla and the cops, the Warden and Turing and Non and Gou at the center of it all... Gou's father perhaps as well, who would appear to be their major antagonist, who later is revealed to be Gou's best resource and partner.

THE INTRODUCTION CHAPTER
## Stealth Mode

PAGE 2 & 3

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTRO: **  Nicola Tesla, creator of the alternating current is muscled and destroyed by JP Morgan Jr (who's there to finish the job his father started).

![](IMG_4232.JPG)

> **PANEL ONE** - PULL BACK FROM PREVIOUS IMAGE AND SHOW THE IMAGE OF THE TESLA COIL THROUGH THE CORNEA OF NICOLA TESLAS EYE. NO DIALOGUE.

* **1 CAP:** If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.

> **PANEL TWO** - PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW NICOLA TESLAS FACE, WIDE EYED AS HE JUST WITNESSES WIRELESS ELECTRICITY WORKING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

* **2 TESLA:** ...free energy...
* **3 TESLA:** ...it works...

> **PANEL THREE** - PULL BACK EVEN FURTHER TO SHOW THE INFAMOUS TESLA COIL AND SPECTACULAR SHOW OF ELECTRICITY. YOUR CALL ON HOW TESLAS FULL FIGURE FITS INTO THIS PANEL.

* **4 TESLA:** ...this changes everything, again...

> **PANEL FOUR** - A STRONG KNOCK AT THE DOOR, SOMEONE IS THERE TO SHUT TESLA DOWN, AGAIN. HE HAD ALREADY HAD HIS TOWER OF DREAMS AND PATENTS SHUT DOWN AND STOLEN BY JP MORGAN.

* **5 POLICE:** Tesla, open the door, we know you're in there. You were told to cease and desist.

* **SOUND:** KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK

* **6 TESLA:** You're making a mistake. The world needs this. We will destroy our planet without it. 

> **PANEL FIVE** - THE DOOR IS KICKED IN AS A CREW OF POLICE RUSH THE OLD APARTMENT WHERE TESLA HAS BEEN TESTING HIS FREE WIRELESS ENERGY SYSTEM. BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN JR, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **7 JP MORGAN:** I got you're letter. Did you think you could undermine my family? 

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. 

* **10 CAP:** The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

**Segway to the Alan Turing section:**

Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour was still ****a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. 

Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning.

In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.

**HISTORICAL FIGURES CAST**

* Nicola Tesla
* Thomas Edison
* Alan Turing
* John Bardeen
* Jack Kilby
* Add 2 females
* Add 2 males

*Each volume will reveal more about each of the historical figures*

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)


> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.


> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.


> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby (BSEE '47) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.

> 1890's - Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1891 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. 

> 1889 - General Electric organizes the first modern research-and-development laboratory. Edison begins work on a storage battery for use in electric cars.

PRESENT DAY

PAGE 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTRO: ** Gou and his brother Nōn are having a mixed conversation in their secret basement headqaurters about their father, hacking and some of the cool stuff Gou's been setting up around the house. You get a sense for what sorts of projects Gou's working on and his relationship with his father and siblings.

What's more interesting in this chapter is that there's clearly a struggle and pressure. Gou is hiding what he's doing from his father, who when first depicted in the book appears to be an angry man. Almost as if a reincarnation of Tesla, only meaner and more badass. In the first chapter, Gou is caught with one of his hacking devices and his father snaps and rages, much like JP Morgan Jr. does in the first scene. 

While Tesla and Turing had to deal with much worse situations, it reminds us that even today, there is always conflict, there is always something or someone standing in your way. Gou's current conflict with his father (who somewhat even resembles Tesla) is a prelude to a much more dramatic situation towards the end of the book.

Eventually, Gou's father teams up with Gou after snapping out of his funk. This happens once the antagonist role is passed off to the greedy vulture capitalist duo (Brad and Eric) who try and steal Gou's invention using lawyers, shady dealings and politics. Gou's father has no choice at this point to shave, shape up and get in gear and represent the ultimate father and sons family business, something many fathers would love to have and share with their sons.

> **NOTE TO ARTIST** The next set of pages and panels are loosley formatted - we may need an extra page or two or we may be able to combine some of these panels. Be sure to review and provide feedback before jumping into doing the bluelines for this section. I'm still waiting on first round of feedback from Colbert.

PAGE 6

> **PANEL ONE** - THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF REVEALING SHOTS GOING FROM FAR TO NEAR OF GOU AND NON IN THEIR HIGHLY SECRETIVE BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS. BEHIND THE STAIRCASE AND AROUND THE BEND OF THE LARGE BASEMENT ROOM, A WALL FILLED WITH STORED STUFF EMERGES. DOZES OF HUGE BOXES STACKED TO THE CEILING REVEALSE GLIMSES OF LIGHT FROM THE CRACKS WHERE THE EDGES OF EACH BOX MEET, RESEMBLING THE OUTLINE OF A DOOR BEHIND THE BOXES. THE BOYS HAVE MASKED AN ENTIRE WALL WITH A DOOR AS IF THE BASEMENT ENDED RIGHT THERE (THE LIGHT IS ONLY ON BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THERE WORKING). WHEN THE CORRECT BOX IS MOVED, A HOLE LEADS TO A DOOR, WHICH ONCE ENTERED OPENS UP INTO GOU'S SECRET BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS (BHQ). IT'S HOW THEY GET IN AND OUT. ONLY THE TWO BROTHERS AT THIS POINT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE. SEE REFERENCES OF WHAT THIS BASEMENT COULD LOOK LIKE BELOW.

* **1 CAP:** Deep in the cool dark basement lies Gou's the secret headquarters, hidden behind thick cardboard boxes filled with the family's old and unused posessions. 

> **PANEL TWO** - CLOSER REVEAL OF THE TWO BOYS WORKING OUT OF GOU'S STEALTH MODE HEADQUARTERS...

* **2 CAP:** Tis not without strife Gou secretly develops his innovations in stealth mode, for his father Chino does not want him to follow in his footsteps.

> **PANEL THREE** - EVEN CLOSER... UNTIL WE GET RIGHT UP BEHIND THEM AND SEE WHAT GOU'S WORKSTATION AND SETUP LOOKS LIKE. OFF AND AROUND THE AREA ARE PALETS OF OLD PC'S COVERED IN TARPS AND STACKS OF OLD PC POWER SUPPLIES THAT GOU HAPPENS TO BE SALVAGING FOR SOME REASON. THE COMPUTER SCREENS HAVE GECKOBOARDS AND GOU IS CLEARLY MONITORING EVERYTING FROM LATEST BITCOIN STOCK PRICES TO SECURITY CAMERAS AROUND THE PROPERTY. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IT'S THE START OF A CIA LIKE HEADQUARTER HACKER OPERATION AND THAT THERE IS A TON OF ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

* **3 CAP:** It's no secret that the worlds greatest inventors, from Davinici to Einstein kept their inventions a secret until they were ready. 

* **4 CAP:** By banning Gou from hacking on code and hardware, Chino had inadvertently created one of the youngest stealth mode hackers on the planet.

PAGE 7

> **PANEL ONE** - FULL PAGE PANEL. GOU IS FIXATED ON A HIGHLY EXPIRAMENTAL PROJECT. IF IT WORKS HIS BITCOIN MINING OPERATION WILL ACTUALLY BECOME PROFITABLE. HE'S TRYING TO SEE IF HE CAN RETROFIT OLD DESKTOP POWER SUPPLIES WITH RODIN COILS, A TOPIC MANY SAY IS PSUEDO SCIENCE. IN THIS MOMENT, WE SEE GOU TRIAGING OUT THE EXISTING COPPER COILS AND EXAMINING THEM UNDER A LIGHT. HE'S FAILED SEVERAL TIMES OF IT AND RODIN COILS ARE CONTROVERSIAL IN THE FIRST PLACE, [HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK THEM UP ON YOUTUBE](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rodin+coil), YOU WILL FIND 50,000 EE'S EXPIRAMENTING WITH THEM. GOU'S TAKING A HUGE RISK BY DOING THIS IN HIS BASEMENT, AS HE'S BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HACK ON COMPUTERS BY HIS FATHER. NON COULD GET IN TROUBLE JUST FOR BEING AROUND GOU IT'S THAT DANGEROUS. AND WHILE TOTALLY CHILL MOST OF THE TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF CHINO, THEIR FATHER. IN THIS PANEL, WE SEE A CLOSEUP OF GOU'S FACE AND THE INTERNAL WIRING OF THE POWER SOURCE AS HE SNIPS THE TWO WIRES CONNECTING THE EXISTING COPPER COIL TO THE BASE OF THE BATTERY. SEE REFERENCE MATERIALS BELOW FOR IMAGES OF THE INSIDE OF A POWER SOURCE AND A RODIN COIL.

* **1 CAP:** Swarn to be a normal boy and not to get caught up in computers and technology, Gou Sokyeo taught himself the art of electrical computer engineering against his fathers wishes.

PAGE 8

> **PANEL ONE** - FIRST EVER SCENE WITH GOU AND NON, THEY ARE INTRODUCED AS A PAIR, ONLY GOU IS CLEARLY THE LEAD HACKER IN THE FAMILY. NON'S JUGGLING A MINI SOCCER BALL (SIZE 1 FUTSAL BALL). AFTER ABOUT 60 JUGGLES HE SMASHES THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SMASHES AN OLD UNUSED MONITOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE IN. NEXT TO HIM IS ARE SEVERAL STACKS OF OLD POWER SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD PCS. THE PCS ARE IN ANOTHER HUGE PILE, COVERED UP BY A TARP, JUST IN CASE.

* **Sound:** Pap, pap, pap, pap

> **PANEL TWO** - A CLOSE UP OF NONS CAREFUL LOOK AS HE JUGGLES THE BALL COMFORTABLY ON HIS FOOT. PROPER FORM IS KEY TO THIS SHOT. 

* **Sound Continues:** Pap, pap, pap, pap, powwwww-boooot!!!

> **PANEL THREE** - NON GOES FROM A JUGGLE TO A VOLLEY KICK, SHOOTING THE BALL INTO A LINE DRIVE ACROSS THE ROOM THEY ARE IN AND NAILS AN OLD COMPUTER SCREEN AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE NONS DESK (WHICH HE NEVER USES).

* **1 Nōn:** 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, g-g-g-g-goooooallllllla-soooooo

> **PANEL FOUR** - NON DOES A CELEBRATION DANCE, THE RONALDO MOVE, AFTER HE SCORES - HE'S EXAGGERATING AND MAKING A BIG DEAL OF THE SILLY GOAL HE SCORES, AND ISN'T PHASED BY DAMAGING THE SCREEN. 

* **2 Gou:** Will you get outta here with that ball! I'm working!

> **PANEL FIVE** - GOU SHOUTS AT NON.

* **3 Nōn:** Hastag Anger Issues. What's dad got against us messing with technology anyhow? And why are you salvaging old PC power sources? 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ccluhu_XIAAcV29.jpg:large)

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU RESPONDS TO NON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED ANYMORE AS HE WORKS ON CLIPPING OUT THE CURRENT COPPER COIL FROM THE POWER SUPPLY WITH A WIRE CUTTING PLIERS. HE RESPONDS TO NON VERY CASUALLY, AS IF BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT NON HAS TO SAY. NON IS WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY AND IS CLEARLY MORE OF A JOCK, WHILE GOU IS DRESSED IN HIS BASEMENT HACKER OUTFIT (SEE CHAPTER WARDROBE NOTES BELOWS)

* **3 Gou** I dunno. I think he doesn't want us to grow up to fast... that and I think something happened to him in the industry just before he went on his sabbatical. And I'm replacing the coils with Rodin Coils. Testing something...

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON STOPS BOUNCING THE BALL AS IF HE'S INTENTIONALLY LEFT IT ROLL AWAY AS HE FACES GOU. HE LOOKS CONCERNED AND NERVOUS FOR GOU AS HE TRIES TO WARN HIM. BUT GOU DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE AS CONCERNED.

* **4 Nōn** You know if he catches you down here with all this stuff he's gonna kill you.

> **PANEL EIGHT** - GOU HOLDS UP THE HC-SRO4 SONAR SENSOR AND EXPLAINS TO NON THAT HE'S IMPLEMENTED HIS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM. GOU HOLDS UP THE SENSORS BEFORE NONS EYES BUT NONS NOT AMAZED, RATHER, HE'S SKETPICAL, AS IF TO SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

* **5 Gou** I got eyes and ears on him all the time. You see this sonar sensor? If he even comes near the basement door upstairs I'll know. 

* **5.1 NOTE** Get the HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor expansion pack online and setup your own security system like Gou. 

* **5.2 QR CODE** http://store.gamifyed.com/#/sonar-expansion-pack

* **6 CAP** Disguised as a normal thirteen year old boy, Gou is one of most elite ECE hackers in the world. From his secret basement headquarters in Garfield Park, he takes part in the most innovative programming and engineering projects known to man. 

PAGE 9

> **PANEL ONE** - THE BOYS CONTINUE TO HACK, AND THE CAMERA BACKS OFF FROM THEM A LITTLE AS THEY CONTINUE TO CHAT.

* **7 Nōn** The guys a couch potatoe.

> **PANEL TWO** - WE CUT TO A SCENE OF CHINO UPSTAIRS LAYING ON THE COUCH IN HIS ROBE. IT'S THE AFTERNOON AND HE CLEARLY HAS NO AMBITION. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THIS PANEL TBD.

* **1 Gou** You know Vero said he wasn't always a bum, and that one day he completely changed, almost as if he gave up on life.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4YL3UsAQ4i-d.jpg)

> **PANEL THREE** - THE IMAGE OF CHINO IS INTERRUPTED BY A RANDOM UH OH MOMENT NON HAS WHEN HE REALIZES HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER LILU. HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER BUT NOT TO WORRY THIS TIME, THE BOYS QUICKLY FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING.

* **2 Nōn** Where's Lilu? 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4GDSUMAApZAt.jpg)

> **PANEL FOUR** - WHILE FOCUSED IN ON THE COIL HE'S FINALLY RIPPED OUT OF THE LAST POWER SUPPLY, GOU CASUALLY MURMERS TO NON THAT LILU IS OUTSIDE FLYING A DRONE HE MADE HER. 

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/image/file/111261/IMG_20160113_180144.jpg?w=580&h=435&fit=max&fm=jpg)

* **3 Gou** She's out flying the drone I built her. Check it out, I can see whatever the drone sees. 

* **4 CAP** TBD

> **PANEL FIVE** - NONS FACE IS PRICELESS. AT FIRST IT SORTA GOES OVER HIS HEAD, BUT THEN 

* **5 Nōn** A drone?

* **6 Nōn** A drone!!!! That's fricking crazy! 

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU PULLS UP THE VIDEO OF LILU'S DRONES CAMERAS POINT OF VIEW AS IT HOVERS OVER THE EDGE OF THE GARFIELD PARK CONSERVATORY WHICH IS PRACTICALLY CONNECTED TO THEIR BACK YARD. THEY TUNE IN AND WATCH THE VIDEO STREAMING FROM THE DRONE ON ONE OF GOU'S MANY COMPUTER SCREENS. NON HOVERS OVER HIS SHOULDER TO TAKE A PEEK AND IS IMPRESSED, BUT NOT ASTONISHED. NON'S USED TO HIS BROTHER DOING STUFF LIKE THIS. GOU SOMETIMES MAKES NON NERVOUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY'LL GET INTO IF THEIR FATHER FINDS OUT THEIR MESSING WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

* **7 Gou** Yeah, check it out, looks like she's flying it over the conservatory out back.
![](http://www.modmypi.com/image/cache/data/rpi-products/raspberry-pi-zero/DSC_0155-800x609.jpg)

* **8 Nōn** That's so cool. You made that with the PI Zero?
 
> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON AWAITS GOUS ANSWER AS GOU FINISHES HIS GLANCE AT THE COMPUTER SCREENS. HE IS SIMULTANIOUSLY HACKING ON HIS PROJECT WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CONVERSATION WITH NON AND WHILE PULLING UP THE DRONES POV CAMERA OVERLOOKING THE ARIAL SHOT OF THE CONSERVATORY.

* **8 Gou** Yep. Two actually, one in the drone and one in the XBOX remote I hacked.

![](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11-Xbox-Pi-Zero-all-wired-up.jpg)

* **7 Nōn** How are you transmitting the footage? 

> **PANEL SEVEN** - GOU HOLDS UP A PARTICLE ELECTRON BOARD

![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0925/6626/products/150803_Particle-27_large.jpg?v=1446682968)

* **8 Gou** Using a Particle Electron, they sent me one to test, it's still in Beta. It's got a Ublox chip that gives me 3G access anywhere a cell phone works. It's nice but the resolution has to be highly compressed for it to stream in real-time.

* **9 CAP** TBD

* **10 Nōn** Dope. You should use that for the near space weather balloon project. 

> **PANEL EIGHT** - TBD

* **11 Gou** Pier 19 baby. Disrupt. Still need to figure out how to insulate everything. It get's pretty cold up there. 

> **PANEL NINE** - TBD

* **11 Nōn** You're crazy. You're gonna get in serious trouble. 

* **12 CAP** TBD

PAGE 10

> **PANEL ONE** - AN ALERT IS TRIGGERD ON GOU'S CELL PHONE. IT GOES OFF WHILE ON HIS WORKSTATION, NEXT TO HIS LAPTOP. A BIRDSEYE VIEW OF HIS DESK IS SHOWN, WITH ALL HIS ELECTRONICS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE AND AN OCULUS RIFT OFF TO THE SIDE. A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET WE SEE GOU USE LATER IN THE BOOK.

* **SOUND** Blip. Blip Bleep. 

* **1 Gou** Crap someones coming. Jinx, open terminal. Jinx, turn on camera eight.

> **PANEL TWO** - CAMERA EIGHT IS TURNED ON IN A WINDOW ON HIS FAR RIGHT UPPER MONITOR. GOU HAS 6 MONITORS, 3 ONTOP OF 3. 

* **2 Gou** Ugh it's Vero. Nevermind. Go distract her and lead her upstairs, tell her I'm at the conservatory doing homework with some friends.

* **3 CAP** Vero, Chino's former front-end engineer is now the kids caretaker. For whatever reasons, she took an oath just before Chino hit rock bottom, never to let his kids suffer.

* **4 Nōn** On it. 

> **PANEL THREE** - NON JETS BACK UP STAIRS TO GREET VERO WHO'S ABOUT TO COME DOWNSTAIRS TO DO LAUNDRY. MAY NEED 2 PANELS HERE.

* **5 Nōn** And you owe me. We're playing soccer later. For two hours straight.

* **6 CAP** Too good of a person, Vero deals with headache after headache helping to raise kids that aren't even hers.

> One of the not-so-obvious side benefits of the miniaturization of electronics is that folks far removed from the realm of electronic engineering become comfortable with small electronic devices and think, “Wouldn’t it be neat if I had a [gizmo] that did…?” Back when computers were called “workstations” their inner workings seemed mysterious, complex, and expensive, and few consumers thought about how they could exploit the computational power. But now that the equivalent of a workstation fits into a hand-sized smartphone complete with a rechargeable power source and a high-definition screen,  software creation is appealing to a non-technical audience. There’s an app for seemingly everything, and even 10-year olds are creating them.
