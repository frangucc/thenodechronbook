Draft - Thursday, September 16th, 2016
Franchino



## The Node Chronicles is a one-of-a-kind graphic novel saga that teaches electrical engineering and computer science (EECS). 

So let's take a second to think about that. A comic book that teaches? How so? And to what degree?

The vast majority of EECS majors we interviewed said they initially got 'sucked in' because someone close to them was highly involved. The main thing they all clearly agreed on was that it was the 'atomoshphere' that got them going. 

Many also agreed that it was a 'desire to build something clever and useful' and said, 'once they figured it out, it got addicting.' 

I chose the graphic novel format because it helps us paint that 'cultural picture' unlike any other medium. As a company, we like to think all people should be able to share in that 'atmosphere' (especially teens), no matter who or where they come from. 

With that said, careful choices had to be made on how work with such limited space for text. The challenge was so great that writing the first 150 pages took over two years of research.

And what exactly is EECS you ask? 

EECS is one of the most exciting and lucrative fields on the planet. It's what's etched in the walls at MIT and according to UC Berkly:

> The integration of EE and CS have now formed strong interactions that extend into biological sciences, mechanical and civil engineering, physical sciences, chemistry, mathematics, and operations research.

For those getting started late, not to worry. History is filled with great engineers and inventors who got started late. The rise of bootcamps, practice apps and learning hubs like the General Assembly, CodeCademy and Udemy have opened up plenty of back-doors for fast learners. But it's no secret that those who do start early are often better off. In that way, *it's becoming a sport.*

While such other methods of teaching are neat and useful, The Node Chronicles is something much different. It's an entirely separate beast. 

TNC is a cultural guide that puts a ton of crap into perspective in an extremely terse, rememberable corpus. It plays like a game of ques and clues and teaches the Hacker Way in strategic proportion to the tutorials. The way we 'set principals' is unlike any other educational experience.

> At Gamifyed, we like to think of all this as a breakthrough method that's never been attempted. And if it works, it could be game changing.

In a nutshell, becoming an EECS hacker isn't just about making money and having a great career either, it's about inventing cool stuff, solving incredible problems and seeing those inventions through to some form of market. And yes technically, it is often about making money - by the boatload. 

# What to learn.

These days the majority of all innovations have some form of computer in them; so that's the area we're going to look at. How do we make new things from scratch with computers in them? And what can these computers do for us?

We'll also take a look at some of the real world industry influencers who've been able to live brilliant lives by leveraging this fascinating craft. In the book we examine their personal lives and atomspheres as well as their unique traits and the socioeconomic behaviors that led to their successes (and failures).

When you realize that computers are getting smaller and smaller, to the point they've become biologic and nanoscopic, you begin to think - they're in your phones, watches, clothing, soccer balls and drones, even your toys and dolls. They're what makes things voice enabled like Siri or location aware. Your dogs coller now has a GPS and new cars like the Tesla have hundreds of sensors that drive the vehicle on it's own. Robots are here amongst us, right now and soon enough, biohacks will cure varoius diseases, regulate failing organs and help the paralyzed walk again! That's cray cray.  

It's even gotten Disney Marvel cray... Harvard scientists are now "copy and pasting" genes with binary controlled DNA munching electrical molecules that can live in your body! What was once sci-fi is now becoming reality. *What an incredible time to be alive.*

So. Are you ready to step up and be a part of the EECS revolution?

## The hacker way.

The word “hacker” has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers I’ve met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world.

The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it — often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo.

> The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

> * Aware, like a fox crossing the water.

> * Alert, like a general on the battlefield. 

> * Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. 

> * Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. 

> * Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

> Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds? The answer exists only in Tao.

And if you've ever interacted with a gifted electrical engineer or programmer then you know there's a certain nerd swagger that the really good ones have. It's hard to describe. Seeing their work can make you buckle and want to quit trying. And when you find out they make as much as doctors, wear flip-flops to work and are so well pampered, you begin to wonder if you can hack too.

While this all sounds gravy, there is one thing you should note: Most of these gurus have been putting in work since they were ~12 years old. Mr. Gladwell would say you need to put 10,000 quality hours in before you become a master, and we agree, somewhat. Woah, that's still a lot of time spent on the computer geeking out!

What Malcom G. doesn't tell you is how to spend those hours. And if you're older, you're not out necessarily, but you certainly can't waste anymore time. That's where this book comes into play. Gamifyed Inc. is quickly establishing itself as a Holacratic Academy for people at all stages of the game. We're like the scouts but for hacking, driven with purpose, enthralled by the potential upside of it all. We're here to make sure you spend all your time learning as efficiently as possible. We try and keep you away from things that aren't worth learning also, because trust us, there's a lot of gunk out there NOT worth learning.

But why do 'hackers' really do what they do? What is it that's so powerful that it can make a man or woman sit for thousands of hours infront of complex code or slave away on microscopic circuits? 

For now, let's just say that there's a secret understanding that the A+ ones have.

> Under the guise of a secret lingo, we level-up on the praise of a thousands of Github stars. Elit3's from all over the planet contribute to our source as our scripts form like Voltron and our whips go fast as hell. 

At MIT, they sometimes refer to all this jargon as the Tao of Programming and at Facebook it's known as 'The Hacker Way.' It's the stuff a lot of people just don't get. Only a small handfull of people are actually a part of it.

For now, all you need to do is be prepared to predict outcomes, stretch your imagination and slay your first dragon. Ok not real dragons but huge metaphorical ones with names like Moores Law and the Big O Notation. 

# Becoming an elit3.

Gamifyed is here to teach you newbs the proper lingo, culture and the hacker way. There might even be something in it for the gods. Within minutes of picking up this book you'll understand. This isn't just some comic book stuffed with buzzwords and cool sounding acronyms, it's a cheat sheet with young bucks riffing about pointers and voltage, arguing over code patterns and memory leaks. *And it's a comic book! What's not to love?* 

If you're a fast learner you'll pick up on quite a bit. Each page acts as a map. Each project serves as a piece of a larger puzzle. And if you hammer through the highly technical QR code crap, you might just establish your nerd-cred on topics ranging from AI algorithms to circuitry and math-ops on the data your sensors produce. Best of all you'll witness everything through the eyes (and over the shoulder) of the youngest, most elit3 hacker in the world, Gou Sokyeo. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917321/gou2.jpg)

Yezzir. We're talking about diving right into some of the most intenese, vivid real-life hacker culture on the planet - that most can't even relate to.

Calm down though, Rome wasn't built in a day. What you need to realize is that from time to time, if you consistently pick up this book and flip through the pages, read it, ponder it and master a tutorial here and there, you'll eventually crack the books code. And on that day you'll realize one thing, *you're getting there.*

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917335/gou5.jpg)

The minute you begin to emulate Gou's traits will forever be the moment that you become an elit3 hacker worthy of a job at any company you wish. And with that you'll have the power to design a life however so you dream.

And when that day comes you'll still find new and exciting stuff to conquer; there will always be a new mission to complete, a invention to launch and a cause worth fighting for. It's what keeps even the most fascinating tech billionaires on the planet going, working harder than anyone else they know - it's because they know that *everything* is possible.

![](https://cl.ly/451Y2j3i1z23/tnc_cover.jpg)

# How it all begins.

Gou Sokyeo and his powerful network of family and friends will be right by your side to help mentor you and keep two steps ahead of the rest. 

While he might not tell you all the time, Gou truly wants you to succeed, but you'll have to earn his respect for that to happen. He's got very little time for bullcrud so you'll have to read between the lines at times. Gou expects you to pick up on things that aren't always obvious, just like your future colleagues will do. Gou expects you to become resourceful. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917324/gou3.jpg)

As a reader you'll dive into the dozens of full life-cycle projects and as you do, pay attention to the situations, opportunities and failures that led to the outcome. If you become enlightened, you'll find out that from Nikola Tesla's discovery of alternating current, to the invention of the Turing Machine and even Twitter, generating you're own luck is what's it's really all about. 

![](https://cl.ly/1b2M0p1m2Y2Q/tnc_5.jpg)

So if you'd someday like to be the one to discover the next new critical API or create the next scientific sensor with universal implications, you'll need to develop some basic instincts first.

![](https://cl.ly/3O470Q2j172y/NC_03_300_Color.jpg)

> The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

Gou will quickly help you get up to speed but the rest is up to you, so get ready to own it.

## About the projects.

The Node Chronicles starts off with a deep dive into the PI Zero (and later the Arduino). The protagonist, Gou Sokyeo examines some critical use cases of these tiny boards while he offers an inpsiring tour of some of the coolest new inventions using them. 

When you follow the QR codes in the book you'll have the opportunity to work on each of the projects and sometimes even link-up with the elit3 mods to demonstrate your progress. If you flip open your laptop or bust out your tablet can even simulate the wiring-up of your first components in 3D! 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2910719/setup.jpg)

Reading about Gou and his network illuminates the common traits the MIT bound Taoist hacker. His work ethic, mindset and personal values are in many ways what lead him to his major breakthroughs. And his life isn't always easy. Things don't always go smooth, as they won't for you at some point. Rest assured the 'network' will embrace you.

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917331/gou4.jpg)

And just so you know, Gou is by all means the youngest, most elit3 hacker on the planet and there are clear reasons why. By now, his personal network is one of the most promising EECS communities on the planet. 

By picking up this book you have just entered into a community where elit3 mods at every major university back Gou up on Github and in IRC. They quickly flock to aid his open source initatives and he's never more than an instant away from other elit3's that can help him solve any problem. You will soon find out if you have what it means to be a part of that community.

So if you think you have what it takes to design your own hardware components, programmatically divide sensor data and write servers to power some of the most sophisticated electrical computing devices on the planet,* get going*. Go to chapter one and get started!

# Working with the hardware.

To take this all one step further, we've decided to create a physical companion package to go along with the entire book. After all, what good is reading about all this stuff if you've never actually rolled up your sleeves and got your hands dirty?

If you begin reding this book and decide this stuff is worth pursuing, definitely grab one of our expansion packs. Each expansion pack has a deck of circuitry cards and a deck of inspiration cards. Together these cards will help you wire up fundamental circuits and gadgets which eventually can be mixed and matched to create your own concepts.

# One last bit on hacking.

For those of you parents and educators still wondering exactly what we mean by 'hacking,' I'll just say this: First, kids are intrigued by the word (whatever it means) and second, hacking is what is considered, dare I say, a new and very real super power - it can be used to perform cyber-crime or to work legitimate wonders. With that power comes great responsibility.

> Millennials and Generation Z want honesty, transparency and opportunity so I decided to use it.

Last year UCLA hosted one of the largest "HACK-A-THONS" in the country, LA Hacks. Ultimately, it's the 'how the heck did you just glitch that' reaction that hackers thrive on. More than a thousand students got together in small squads to hack on some insanely cool, spur of the moment stuff, like automonous docking drones and breakthrough machine learning algorithms. After three nights spent in the gym, the entire stadium ended up completely packed as the finalists presented on stage.

![](https://cl.ly/1Y100z152k3O/lahacks.jpg)

I'm confronted constantly by people who say not to use the term as it will confused parents and teachers into thinking it's a book about illegal activity. The problem is those same people have never even heard of a hackathon or know very little about the industry. They're somewhat outdated.

And when you see a job ad for a JavaScript hacker or read about the 10 year old finnish kid who was given a $10,000 bug bounty for hacking Instagram, you begin to realize 'hacking' is a fundamental ability. 

Some even argue that Tesla was hacking electricity and Edisons DC empire when he pioneered alternating current. Alan Turing was legitimately cracking the enigma when he discovered the modern computer's fundamental main algorithm, the Turing or State Machine. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917317/turing.jpg)

And like so many other scientists, mathmeticians and invetors before him, he was messed with, persecuted and criticized for his work and his personal life - to the extent it ruined his life. While society is much more accepting today, there are still many dangers inventors and entreprenours face. Using a vast historical perspective, we tend to speak on politics quite a bit.

Hacking is just a skill, like marksmanship.  If somebody is an expert marksman, and they only shoot targets in safe, controlled environment then he's not 'bad'.  If instead that marksman uses his skill to shoot a dozen innocent people at a movie theatre, then he's bad.

It's not the skill that made him good or bad.  It's what he did with the skill. Those using their ability to hack to commit illegal and immoral acts are NEVER championed by us. In-fact, we even confront them in the book at some point and draw a clear line in the sand about what's right and wrong. 

In a nutshell, hacking is a skill that the world needs more of (the good kind of course).

# Teaching isn't just about memorization.

Gamifyed is a new company exploring an expiramental new transmedia method of teaching. Our initial barriers in convincing young teens to willingly spend time on this we're unsettling. What we ultimately found is that they need new forms of motivation to break the barrier. Suffice it to say, *we've been obsessed with figuring this out.*

We've done tons of formal research on 'why gifted hackers spend such huge amounts of time learning, exploiting and tampering with technology.' We looked carefully at the moments when hackers had their first 'aha moments' and when they 'just knew they could code.' We like to think our findings have been incorporated into every picture, facial expression, text and QR code in the book.

Throughout this process, we've also found that *being able to leverage the graphic novel format* completely unshackles us from what the traditional text book has to offer. And we believe that some day 3D games on conosoles or VR platforms add to this. These new age mediums some day play a much greater role in the rapid onset of deep tech education. 

In the future, we plan to investigate this idea thoroughly. Having a graphic novel foundation with a full cast and concept put's us in the unique position to actually develop such new experiences in the future.

To dabble in this, we've even setup tests with kids to measure how they learn when using different forms of media. Given the same content on paper in text form, graphic form and as a story-mode in a game, we observed that in game form, not only was retention of information higher, but that kids were more likely to want to continue on. 

Next to that we discovered full color, rich graphics combined with storyform content, no matter whether in print or in storymode, was twice as impactful on the learner.

![](https://cl.ly/080Q0I1G1y21/non_reading.jpg)

The field of ECE is expanding rapidly and includes a combination of EE, CS and Software Engineering. Our 'GISTT' graphic textbook covers these fields in an way that continuously praises the well grounded engineerist for his theoretical thought process and simulatanious knowledge of the business and strategies many have used to successfully launch their products. 

![](https://cl.ly/3o3n003Q0d35/tnc_8.jpg)

If we as a company were to coin an acronym for the phenomenom we're pioneering, we'd call it: Graphicly Interactive Storytelling Transmedia Textbook or GISTT. But before we go and throw that term around, know that we're still just figuring all this out. Whether or not the classroom is meant to feel more like Disney or Marvel or an immersive video gaming experience has yet to be proven. One can only speculate right now and you the reader will have to keep us informed.

![](https://cl.ly/0e2R282i2L3d/tnc_6.jpg)

# Young prodigies.

In general, prodigies are becoming the new norm within the American household and the stereotypes are narrowing. Yes, there are some stereotypes about hackers. It isn't just geeky boys learning to code anymore it's sweet, normal little girls who are good at math and football playing class presidents who want to change the world. It's transcended across every continent, skintone and background, so long as you have a computer, internet and proper context. 

What we do know is that our user research over the past two years has consistently demonstrated that young masters of success latch onto vivid context. Girls obsessed with watching professional athletes on YouTube teach themselves new techniques and become prodigies. Boys inspired by talented singers on Television watch and listen to clips over and over. Young children with the patience and warewithall to sit and do art for hours upon consecutive hours become great classical artists, and so on. There isn't just one factor that consistently produces prodigies, *which is why we examine several.*

![](https://cl.ly/3o2r0t0v2934/tnc_lilu.jpg)

The idea that your child has other options besides just sports or music has never been more present. The notion that you could become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Sergay Brin has become evident by the number of unicorns surfacing all of the World. Teens are literally building things in their basements that go online and become worth millions of dollars. 

![](https://cl.ly/272Y2L370j2n/tnc_2.jpg)

# Proof of concept.

The Node Chronicles attempts to be what Thrasher magazine was to skateboarding in the 80's and 90's - a movement which led to the exponential motivation and advancement of the sport. Today's professional skateboarders are doing unthinkable things because of Thrashers ability to steadily capture the industry at any given moment and make others fall inlove with the culture.

The show Mr. Robot and The Silicon Valley recently highlighted that television could be combined with reasonably accurate technical content to create a show loved by millions while being cultishly coveted by an entire industry. Fans of these shows who code or do start-ups love one thing, that they are somewhat accurate on the technical content. Millions more are even more fascinated who know less about the field and it's because the field is filled with excitement, danger, risk, betrayal and tons of other concerns. A media scan at any given moment is all you need to find inspiration for this sort of action. 

The fact is that each day, thousands of elit3's out there write incredibly amazing tutorials with simply the hopes of passing down their trade. Gamifyed ultimately wants to be the ones curating this stuff on more than just a blog. We also feel that this stuff all needs to fit it more of a classical context. 

When reading this book from cover-to-cover, in just under a couple hours, you'll walk away with a sense of accomplishment, a new vocabulary and theoretical base of knowledge that's well worth the $75 dollars. You'll also have a much better knowledge of how all these pieces fit together and in what order you should learn them.

### *Excerpts and Random Facts*

The Node Chronicles is pushing a similar boundary in American education. With more than 250 schools already analyzing this for their classrooms and 2500 books sold, the user feedback we've gotten can be grouped into three important statistics about this book.

* 250 teachers representing close to 250 schools purchased the book unaware that they were part of a survey. Each were shipped the first edition and given a month to analyze the book. After the first month they were given a survey. Of the 250 surveys sent, 226 responded within a week. 

* 96% of the respondands answered three simple questions .

* How likely are you to push to make this required reading for your STEM program?

* How likely are you to recommend this to parents interested in their kids learning about electronics, coding and computer engineering?

* How likely are you to purchase more products from us in the future?
 
**Here were the results of the survey. **

-- SKIP to preface.

In 2017, Gamifyed will continue to invest in it's vision to become the leading cultural curator for classrooms and homes where ECE is quickly becoming a top priority. With 50 billion IoT Devices to come online by the year 2020 and each field becoming an information technology field, the prospect of a new "academy" style cultural movement for kids and teenagers could be huge. 

The Node Chronicles is the first real, American born, globally relevant graphic novel based on the fascinating tech culture, with historical references to pioneers and their personal situations ranging from and Alan Turing to Bill Gates and Massimo Banzi. 

And as you proceed and others take note to your accomplishments in this field, you'll quickly find the warewithall you need to become addicted. You'll power up fast, and if you don't, your doing something wrong. If you're following Gou's lead, you'll want to keep doing it more and more until the stuff just oozes from you, until you sweat in binary and learn to co-exist as if a quibit. 

If you listen to Gou for me, I promise you one day it will just hit you. Bam. You'll wake up and realize you're not a newb anymore and that others will completely respect you for your hacking chops. Your friends jaws will drop as they watch you earn cold hard cash coding from your dorm room. They'll admire your ability to build anything you can fathom and soon enough, you'll become what's known as an guru or an elit3.

While other economies around the world lead in manufacturing and even education, America is typically known for their innovation. We also happen to be the leading contributors to the open source movement by a landslide.

### *Volume 1*

NOTE TO EARLY READERS: 

We are open sourcing the core of our curriculum, make no mistake of that. Any attempt to make money by charging for our products at this stage of the game is simply to fund what we do. This will never change. In other words, there will be pull requests to this document.

With that said please wait for instruction on contributing. We will announce an open activity for all those interested in contributing to our underlying research and knowledge base. We respect a wide variety of motives for advising or contributing, so please get in touch with Frank@fye2.com if interested. 

Please also consider there are many factors that go into this type of project. This document is slowly being updated and we appreciate you're patience. 

## **PREFACE**

To be the king, one has to know he is the king:

The life in front of us is a scrambled pattern of mostly other peoples ideas, some of them good, some of them bad. To navigate the tech jungle the mind must be sharp like a machete. The Gamifyed group of core contributors think about one thing and one thing only, how to streamline the information we see ahead; we fight to pave the path infront of the next generation. 

This is the **missing curriculum** people! Your kids are going to read some of it, all of it, or heck maybe just look at the pics. You will read parts, maybe all of it, and some will go an even step further and investigate the ideas and links we've put in the book and find that this is a book of modern magic we sometimes call hacking. Not black, not white, perhaps gray, sometimes for profit and possibly even risky. 

> Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

**BOOK PREFACE**

What started as a simple experiment with fundamentals and graphic content has now become a globally recognized platform embraced by teachers, parents and young innovators everywhere.

It's been 3 years since that first test and research become much more forensic. Does a newb (or even an adult) retain information differently with this format? Does this format help draw kids in over their other devices? How exactly should we layer in complexity for the different age groups? 

Gamifyed is the first mover to go full-speed ahead with this idea. With the help of former Marvel artists, DC writers and top ECE practitioners our goal is to genuinely inspire and teach young readers using a carefully stitched together technical literature, tutorials, action, movement, suspense, drama, politics, hardships and real-world scenarios. Gamifyed wants this to be the book you can't put down; the path to some serious techno enlightenment, a segway to some serious hacking abilities.

Passing down a careful blend of must know topics tied to dramatic situations is what makes this format so unique to me. I can do with it what regular text books have never been able to and I can re-create these moments with intense illustrations and action. Major textbook publishers would never dare mix controversial values, deep politics and grit with learning - let alone comic books. And I don't disagree. School isn't a place for super off topic, experimental indy written content by enlarge. But the general curriculum also isn't a place for developing prodigies now is it?

And that's what this book is really about: the 'missing curriculum - it's about not letting our kids get any older without understanding certain things and what it means to be equipped with the power of ECE. The young mind is powerful, kids exhibit extreme memory and learning capabilities when they play video games or sports.

So I digress; If you're looking for something less gritty, try Kano or the Manga Guides. If you're looking for something seriously hardcore that's built from the ground up with careful research, something that can genuinely build a real interest, choose Gamifyed and The Node Chronicles. 


** Target Audience**

The simple answer is 9 to 19 year olds. PLTW Info....

The more complicated answer is: almost everything Gou and his friends demonstrate in this book can be repeated by the reader. The book features a ton of QR code code extended content, open source code snippets and a flagship feature, expansion packs. Expansion Packs are physical kits that go along with each chapter. The goal is to offer reasonably priced, a la carte hardware packs to give readers the real-world hands on experience they need to succeed in this field. In the tech industry, it's all about what you have done and demonstrating tangible abilities - so let's not be hasty here. Anyone capable of reading a comic book will benefit from this book.

> **PANEL FOUR** - A STRONG KNOCK AT THE DOOR, SOMEONE IS THERE TO SHUT TESLA DOWN, AGAIN. HE HAD ALREADY HAD HIS TOWER OF DREAMS AND PATENTS SHUT DOWN AND STOLEN BY JP MORGAN.

* **5 POLICE:** Tesla, open the door, we know you're in there. You were told to cease and desist.

* **SOUND:** KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK

* **6 TESLA:** You're making a mistake. The world needs this. We will destroy our planet without it. 

> **PANEL FIVE** - THE DOOR IS KICKED IN AS A CREW OF POLICE RUSH THE OLD APARTMENT WHERE TESLA HAS BEEN TESTING HIS FREE WIRELESS ENERGY SYSTEM. BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN JR, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **7 JP MORGAN:** I got you're letter. Did you think you could undermine my family? 

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. 

* **10 CAP:** The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

**Segway to the Alan Turing section:**

Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behavior was still ****a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. 

Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning.

Alan Turing invented the turing machine to crack Nazi code generated by their infamous Enigma Machine. By deciphering encrypted messages captured over the air waves, Turing helped the opposition learn the Nazi's plans and positioning for attack. The turing machine would later become the premise of every modern computer. Finite State Machines are what interprets the binary system of all mainstream hardware and operating systems to this very day. He is considered one of the most significant inventors of the 20th century.

* Add 2 males

*Each volume will reveal more about each of the historical figures*

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)

> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.


> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.


> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby (BSEE '47) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.

> 1890's - Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1891 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. 

> 1889 - General Electric organizes the first modern research-and-development laboratory. Edison begins work on a storage battery for use in electric cars.

PRESENT DAY, PAGES 11-20

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTERNAL INTRO: ** Gou and his brother Nōn are having a mixed conversation in their secret basement headquarters about their father, hacking and some of the cool stuff Gou's been setting up around the house. You get a sense for what sorts of projects Gou's working on and his relationship with his father and siblings.

What's more interesting in this chapter is that there's clearly a struggle and pressure. Gou is hiding what he's doing from his father, who when first depicted in the book appears to be an angry man. Almost as if a reincarnation of Tesla, only meaner and more badass. In the first chapter, Gou is caught with one of his hacking devices and his father snaps and rages, much like JP Morgan Jr. does in the first scene. 

While Tesla and Turing had to deal with much worse situations, it reminds us that even today, there is always conflict, there is always something or someone standing in your way. Gou's current conflict with his father (who somewhat even resembles Tesla) is a prelude to a much more dramatic situation towards the end of the book.

Eventually, Gou's father teams up with Gou after snapping out of his funk. This happens once the antagonist role is passed off to the greedy vulture capitalist duo (Brad and Eric) who try and steal Gou's invention using lawyers, shady dealings and politics. Gou's father has no choice at this point to shave, shape up and get in gear and represent the ultimate father and sons family business, something many fathers would love to have and share with their sons.

PAGE 11 & 12 [PROPERTY & BASEMENT INTRO]

``````

![](https://cl.ly/3H2x0X10460z/NC_06_v2_72.jpg)

* **1 CAP:** Thus 'stealth mode' was their only option; Tesla, Turing and the hundreds of pioneers who came before Gou Sokeyo paid the ultimate sacrafices, their inventions forwarded and eventually, even their lives were lost. Human greed and lust for power will never change; there's always a snake in the grass waiting to strike. 

* **2 CAP:** For the two boys and their sister Lilu, why their father bought the old Frank Lloyd Wright house has and will always be a mystery. Vero their caretaker says it was a bad investment their father Chino made just before he cracked up and quit working. 

* **3 CAP:** Tucked away hidden down in the back of a prohibition era basement exists one of todays greatest young hackers. Frightened more than by any, his father hasn't the slightest clue what he's up to downstairs, for if he had, he would "KILL HIM."

> **PANEL ONE** - THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF REVEALING SHOTS GOING FROM FAR TO NEAR OF GOU AND NON IN THEIR HIGHLY SECRETIVE BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS. BEHIND THE STAIRCASE AND AROUND THE BEND OF THE LARGE BASEMENT ROOM, A WALL FILLED WITH STORED STUFF EMERGES. DOZES OF HUGE BOXES STACKED TO THE CEILING REVEALSE GLIMSES OF LIGHT FROM THE CRACKS WHERE THE EDGES OF EACH BOX MEET, RESEMBLING THE OUTLINE OF A DOOR BEHIND THE BOXES. THE BOYS HAVE MASKED AN ENTIRE WALL WITH A DOOR AS IF THE BASEMENT ENDED RIGHT THERE (THE LIGHT IS ONLY ON BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THERE WORKING). WHEN THE CORRECT BOX IS MOVED, A HOLE LEADS TO A DOOR, WHICH ONCE ENTERED OPENS UP INTO GOU'S SECRET BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS (BHQ). IT'S HOW THEY GET IN AND OUT. ONLY THE TWO BROTHERS AT THIS POINT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE. SEE REFERENCES OF WHAT THIS BASEMENT COULD LOOK LIKE BELOW.

![](https://cl.ly/1J221G2v2z2h/NC_06_72.jpg)

FRANK TODO: Add references to this scene about the green mill, al capones old hideouts, pathways to city hall - this interesting place could be the underground railroad in Chicago.

The general idea of the 10th and 11th page is that it's the opening to the setting. Zoom from afar to see the big home and what the landscape looks like. Zoom into see the ornate brickwork of the old politicians small mansion in Garfield Park. Get into the basement, which rumor has it was once connected to Al Capones underground railroad system and that you could get to city hall and the green mill from the basement tunnels. Just at the foot of the tunnel is the last room which is the only access to the tunnel. This is where Gou and Non have setup shop. The room is blocked off by a bunch of old boxes, Lily, Chino and Vero have no idea it's there. 

> **PANEL TWO** - CLOSER REVEAL OF THE TWO BOYS WORKING OUT OF GOU'S STEALTH MODE HEADQUARTERS...

![](https://cl.ly/2R2b351z2U2C/NC_08_72.jpg)

* **2 CAP:** Tis not without strife Gou secretly develops his innovations in stealth mode, for his father Chino does not want him to follow in his footsteps. [Add much more cleverness to this caption: As in the days of yester the top inventors, for whatever reasons, worked in stealth mode. Stuff about copycats, greedy companies and politicians are always searching for the next big thing and they lack their own creativity to invent them.]

> **PANEL THREE** - EVEN CLOSER... UNTIL WE GET RIGHT UP BEHIND THEM AND SEE WHAT GOU'S WORKSTATION AND SETUP LOOKS LIKE. OFF AND AROUND THE AREA ARE PALETS OF OLD PC'S COVERED IN TARPS AND STACKS OF OLD PC POWER SUPPLIES THAT GOU HAPPENS TO BE SALVAGING FOR SOME REASON. THE COMPUTER SCREENS HAVE GECKOBOARDS AND GOU IS CLEARLY MONITORING EVERYTING FROM LATEST BITCOIN STOCK PRICES TO SECURITY CAMERAS AROUND THE PROPERTY. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IT'S THE START OF A CIA LIKE HEADQUARTER HACKER OPERATION AND THAT THERE IS A TON OF ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

* **3 CAP:** It's no secret that the worlds greatest inventors, from Davinici to Einstein kept their inventions a secret until they were ready. 

* **4 CAP:** By banning Gou from hacking on code and hardware, his father Chino had inadvertently created one of the youngest stealth mode hackers on the planet.

PAGE 13

> **PANEL ONE** - FULL PAGE PANEL. GOU IS FIXATED ON A HIGHLY EXPIRAMENTAL PROJECT WHICH HE DOESN'T QUITE SHARE WITH THE READER YET (SPOILER ALERT, IT'S THE NODE). GOU'S TAKING A HUGE RISK BY DOING THIS IN HIS BASEMENT, AS HE'S BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HACK ON COMPUTERS BY HIS FATHER. NON COULD GET IN TROUBLE JUST FOR BEING AROUND GOU IT'S THAT DANGEROUS. AND WHILE TOTALLY CHILL MOST OF THE TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF CHINO, THEIR FATHER. IN THIS PANEL, WE SEE A CLOSEUP OF GOU'S FACE AND NODE.

* **1 CAP:** Swarn to be a normal boy and not to get caught up in computers and technology, Gou Sokyeo taught himself the art of electrical computer engineering against his fathers wishes. 


PAGE 14 [SHOWING OFF, GOU & NON FIRST DIALOGUE]

> **PANEL ONE** - FIRST EVER SCENE WITH GOU AND NON, THEY ARE INTRODUCED AS A PAIR, ONLY GOU IS CLEARLY THE LEAD HACKER IN THE FAMILY. NON'S JUGGLING A MINI SOCCER BALL (SIZE 1 FUTSAL BALL). AFTER ABOUT 60 JUGGLES HE SMASHES THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SMASHES AN OLD UNUSED MONITOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE IN. NEXT TO HIM IS ARE SEVERAL STACKS OF OLD POWER SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD PCS. THE PCS ARE IN ANOTHER HUGE PILE, COVERED UP BY A TARP, JUST IN CASE.

* **Sound:** Pap, pap, pap, pap

> **PANEL TWO** - A CLOSE UP OF NONS CAREFUL LOOK AS HE JUGGLES THE BALL COMFORTABLY ON HIS FOOT. PROPER FORM IS KEY TO THIS SHOT. 

* **Sound Continues:** Pap, pap, pap, pap, powwwww-boooot!!!

> **PANEL THREE** - NON GOES FROM A JUGGLE TO A VOLLEY KICK, SHOOTING THE BALL INTO A LINE DRIVE ACROSS THE ROOM THEY ARE IN AND NAILS AN OLD COMPUTER SCREEN AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE NONS DESK (WHICH HE NEVER USES).

* **1 Nōn:** 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, g-g-g-g-goooooallllllla-soooooo

> **PANEL FOUR** - NON DOES A CELEBRATION DANCE, THE RONALDO MOVE, AFTER HE SCORES - HE'S EXAGGERATING AND MAKING A BIG DEAL OF THE SILLY GOAL HE SCORES, AND ISN'T PHASED BY DAMAGING THE SCREEN. 

* **2 Gou:** Will you get outta here with that ball! I'm working!

> **PANEL FIVE** - GOU SHOUTS AT NON.

* **3 Nōn:** Hastag Anger Issues. What's dad got against us messing with technology anyhow? And why are you salvaging old PC power sources? 

``````

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ccluhu_XIAAcV29.jpg:large)

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU RESPONDS TO NON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED ANYMORE AS HE WORKS ON A PART OF THE NODE. HE RESPONDS TO NON VERY CASUALLY, AS IF BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT NON HAS TO SAY. NON IS WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY AND IS CLEARLY MORE OF A JOCK, WHILE GOU IS DRESSED IN HIS BASEMENT HACKER OUTFIT (SEE CHAPTER WARDROBE NOTES BELOWS)

* **3 Gou** I dunno. I think he doesn't want us to grow up to fast... that and I think something happened to him in the industry just before he went on his sabbatical. And I'm replacing the coils with Rodin Coils. Testing something...

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON STOPS BOUNCING THE BALL AS IF HE'S INTENTIONALLY LEFT IT ROLL AWAY AS HE FACES GOU. HE LOOKS CONCERNED AND NERVOUS FOR GOU AS HE TRIES TO WARN HIM. BUT GOU DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE AS CONCERNED.

* **4 Nōn** You know if he catches you down here with all this stuff he's gonna kill you.

> **PANEL EIGHT** - GOU HOLDS UP THE HC-SRO4 SONAR SENSOR AND EXPLAINS TO NON THAT HE'S IMPLEMENTED HIS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM. GOU HOLDS UP THE SENSORS BEFORE NONS EYES BUT NONS NOT AMAZED, RATHER, HE'S SKETPICAL, AS IF TO SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

* **5 Gou** I got eyes and ears on him all the time. You see this sonar sensor? If he even comes near the basement door upstairs I'll know. 

* **5.1 NOTE** Get the HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor expansion pack online and setup your own security system like Gou. 

* **5.2 QR CODE** http://store.gamifyed.com/#/sonar-expansion-pack

* **6 CAP** Disguised as a normal thirteen year old boy, Gou is one of most elite ECE hackers in the world. From his secret basement headquarters in Garfield Park, he takes part in the most innovative programming and engineering projects known to man. 


PAGE 15 [DAD UPSTAIRS SOLEMNLY WATCHING ASSHOLES ON TV]

![](https://cl.ly/0M2V1Q353f2i/NC_10_72.jpg)

> **PANEL ONE** - THE BOYS CONTINUE TO HACK, AND THE CAMERA BACKS OFF FROM THEM A LITTLE AS THEY CONTINUE TO CHAT.

* **7 Nōn** The guys a couch potatoe.

> **PANEL TWO** - WE CUT TO A SCENE OF CHINO UPSTAIRS LAYING ON THE COUCH IN HIS ROBE. IT'S THE AFTERNOON AND HE CLEARLY HAS NO AMBITION. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THIS PANEL TBD.

* **1 Gou** You know Vero said he wasn't always a bum, and that one day he completely changed, almost as if he gave up on life.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4YL3UsAQ4i-d.jpg)

> **PANEL THREE** - THE IMAGE OF CHINO IS INTERRUPTED BY A RANDOM UH OH MOMENT NON HAS WHEN HE REALIZES HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER LILU. HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER BUT NOT TO WORRY THIS TIME, THE BOYS QUICKLY FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING.

* **2 Nōn** Where's Lilu? 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4GDSUMAApZAt.jpg)

> **PANEL FOUR** - WHILE FOCUSED IN ON THE COIL HE'S FINALLY RIPPED OUT OF THE LAST POWER SUPPLY, GOU CASUALLY MURMERS TO NON THAT LILU IS OUTSIDE FLYING A DRONE HE MADE HER. 

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/image/file/111261/IMG_20160113_180144.jpg?w=580&h=435&fit=max&fm=jpg)

* **3 Gou** She's out flying the drone I built her. Check it out, I can see whatever the drone sees. 

* **4 CAP** TBD

> **PANEL FIVE** - NONS FACE IS PRICELESS. AT FIRST IT SORTA GOES OVER HIS HEAD, BUT THEN, POW IT HITS HIM.

* **5 Nōn** A drone? But who, but when?

* **6 Nōn** A drone!!!! You made a drone! That's fricking crazy! 

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU PULLS UP THE VIDEO OF LILU'S DRONES CAMERAS POINT OF VIEW AS IT HOVERS OVER THE EDGE OF THE GARFIELD PARK CONSERVATORY WHICH IS PRACTICALLY CONNECTED TO THEIR BACK YARD. THEY TUNE IN AND WATCH THE VIDEO STREAMING FROM THE DRONE ON ONE OF GOU'S MANY COMPUTER SCREENS. NON HOVERS OVER HIS SHOULDER TO TAKE A PEEK AND IS IMPRESSED, BUT NOT ASTONISHED. NON'S USED TO HIS BROTHER DOING STUFF LIKE THIS. GOU SOMETIMES MAKES NON NERVOUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY'LL GET INTO IF THEIR FATHER FINDS OUT THEIR MESSING WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

* **7 Gou** Yeah, check it out, looks like she's flying it over the conservatory out back.
![](http://www.modmypi.com/image/cache/data/rpi-products/raspberry-pi-zero/DSC_0155-800x609.jpg)

* **8 Nōn** That's so cool. You made that with the PI Zero?

![](https://cl.ly/191G3X280W1H/NC_12_72.jpg)

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON AWAITS GOUS ANSWER AS GOU FINISHES HIS GLANCE AT THE COMPUTER SCREENS. HE IS SIMULTANIOUSLY HACKING ON HIS PROJECT WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CONVERSATION WITH NON AND WHILE PULLING UP THE DRONES POV CAMERA OVERLOOKING THE ARIAL SHOT OF THE CONSERVATORY.

* **8 Gou** Yep. Two actually, one in the drone and one in the XBOX remote I hacked.

![](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11-Xbox-Pi-Zero-all-wired-up.jpg)

* **7 Nōn** How are you transmitting the footage? 

> **PANEL SEVEN** - GOU HOLDS UP A PARTICLE ELECTRON BOARD

![](https://cl.ly/3c0Q2o1H3V0f/NC_09_72.jpg)

* **8 Gou** Using a Particle Electron, they sent me one to test, it's still in Beta. It's got a Ublox chip that gives me 3G access anywhere a cell phone works. It's nice but the resolution has to be highly compressed for it to stream in real-time.

* **9 QR CODE** Get the drone expansion pack at http://shop.gamifyed.com/#/drones 

* **10 Nōn** Dope. You should use that for the near space weather balloon project. 

> **PANEL EIGHT** - A CLOSE UP OF GOU'S FACE AS IF HE'S LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE AND IT'S AMAZING.

* **11 Gou** Pier 19 baby. Disrupt. Still need to figure out how to insulate everything. It get's pretty cold up there. 

> **PANEL NINE** - TBD

* **11 Nōn** You're crazy. You're gonna get in serious trouble. 

* **12 CAP** TBD


PAGE 15

> **PANEL ONE** - AN ALERT IS TRIGGERD ON GOU'S CELL PHONE. IT GOES OFF WHILE ON HIS WORKSTATION, NEXT TO HIS LAPTOP. A BIRDSEYE VIEW OF HIS DESK IS SHOWN, WITH ALL HIS ELECTRONICS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE AND AN OCULUS RIFT OFF TO THE SIDE. A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET WE SEE GOU USE LATER IN THE BOOK.

* **SOUND** Blip. Blip Bleep. 

* **1 Gou** Crap someones coming. Jinx, open terminal. Jinx, turn on camera eight.

> **PANEL TWO** - CAMERA EIGHT IS TURNED ON IN A WINDOW ON HIS FAR RIGHT UPPER MONITOR. GOU HAS 6 MONITORS, 3 ONTOP OF 3. VERO IS WALKING DOWN THE LAST HALL BEFORE THE BASEMENT WITH A LAUNDRY BASKET.

* **2 Gou** Ugh it's Vero. Nevermind. Go distract her and lead her upstairs, tell her I'm at the conservatory doing homework with some friends.

* **3 CAP** Vero, Chino's former front-end engineer is now the kids caretaker. For whatever reasons, she took an oath just before Chino hit rock bottom, never to let his kids suffer.

* **4 Nōn** On it. 

> **PANEL THREE** - NON JETS BACK UP STAIRS TO GREET VERO WHO'S ABOUT TO COME DOWNSTAIRS TO DO LAUNDRY. MAY NEED 2 PANELS HERE.

* **5 Nōn** And you owe me. We're playing soccer later. For two hours straight.

* **6 CAP** Too good of a person, Vero deals with headache after headache helping to raise kids that aren't even hers.
