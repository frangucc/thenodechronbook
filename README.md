Draft - Thursday, September 22nd, 2016

## The Node Chronicles is a one-of-a-kind, PG-13 graphic novel saga that teaches electrical engineering and computer science (EECS). 

So let's take a second to think about that. A comic book that teaches? How so? And to what degree? 

The vast majority of EECS majors we interviewed said they initially got 'sucked in' because someone close to them was highly involved. The main thing they all clearly agreed on was that it was the 'atomoshphere' that got them going. 

![](https://d17oy1vhnax1f7.cloudfront.net/items/0l1V1a0D3H0m2u023K2Z/again_bjy1p5.jpg?v=b5dba873)

Many also agreed that it was a 'desire to build something clever and useful' and said, 'once they figured it out, it got addicting.' 

I chose the graphic novel format because it helps us paint that 'cultural picture' unlike any other medium. As a company, we like to think all people should be able to share in that 'atmosphere' (especially teens), no matter who or where they come from. 

With that said, careful choices had to be made on how work with such limited space for text. The challenge was so great that writing the first 150 pages took over two years of research. In-fact, our research never stops, it's always ongoing. You can even contribute by going [here](https://goo.gl/forms/kvYGpnBg6f8beEGt1). 

And what exactly is EE/CS you ask? (also referred to as ECE) 

![](http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N51/graphics/fbookevent-6.jpg)

EE/CS is one of the most exciting and lucrative fields on the planet. The words are etched in the walls at MIT and according to UC Berkly:

> The integration of EE and CS have now formed strong interactions that extend into biological sciences, mechanical and civil engineering, physical sciences, chemistry, mathematics, and operations research.

And if you're still a bit confused as to where you've just landed, the author invites you to watch this video of the current process of Book 1, The Node Chronicles - They Hacker Way.

> The hardest part about learning EECS is simply wrapping your head around it. - Franchino, Creator of The Node Chronicles

For those getting started late, not to worry. History is filled with great engineers and inventors who got started late. The rise of bootcamps, practice apps and learning hubs like the General Assembly, CodeCademy and Udemy have opened up plenty of back-doors for fast learners. But it's no secret that those who do start early are often better off. In that way, *it's becoming a sport.*

![](http://clubhousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/LA-hackathon.jpg)

While such other methods of teaching are neat and useful, The Node Chronicles is something much different. It's an entirely separate beast. 

TNC is a cultural guide that puts a ton of crap into perspective in an extremely terse, rememberable corpus. It plays like a game of ques and clues and teaches the Hacker Way in strategic proportion to the tutorials. The way we 'set principals' is unlike any other educational experience.

> At Gamifyed, we like to think of all this as a breakthrough method that's never been attempted. And if it works, it could be game changing.

In a nutshell, becoming an EECS hacker isn't just about making money and having a great career either, it's about inventing cool stuff, solving incredible problems and seeing those inventions through to some form of market. And yes technically, it is often about making money - by the boatload. 

Here's just a preview of all the moving subjects. It's quite the challenge!

# What to learn.

These days the majority of all innovations have some form of computer in them; so that's the area we're going to look at. How do we make new things from scratch with computers in them? And what can these computers do for us?

The scope of what's in the book sorta looks like this:

![](https://cl.ly/162v3A3G352j/file.jpg)
> Dare we illustrate this...

We'll also take a look at some of the real world industry influencers who've been able to live brilliant lives by leveraging this fascinating craft. In the book we examine their personal lives and atomspheres as well as their unique traits and the socioeconomic behaviors that led to their successes (and failures).

![](https://cl.ly/0s42011Q0G0G/TNC_Banzi.jpg)

When you realize that computers are getting smaller and smaller, to the point they've become biologic and nanoscopic, you begin to think - they're in your phones, watches, clothing, soccer balls and drones, even your toys and dolls. They're what makes things voice enabled like Siri or location aware. Your dogs coller now has a GPS and new cars like the Tesla have hundreds of sensors that drive the vehicle on it's own. Robots are here amongst us, right now and soon enough, biohacks will cure varoius diseases, regulate failing organs and help the paralyzed walk again! That's cray cray.  

![](https://cl.ly/1z1z0q1O0H1Z/tnc_stone.jpg)

It's even gotten Disney Marvel cray... Harvard scientists are now "copy and pasting" genes with binary controlled DNA munching electrical molecules that can live in your body! What was once sci-fi is now becoming reality. *What an incredible time to be alive.*

So. Are you ready to step up and be a part of the EECS revolution? In a nutshell, this is what we're gonna learn. 

## The hacker way.

The word “hacker” has an unfairly negative connotation from being portrayed in the media as people who break into computers. In reality, hacking just means building something quickly or testing the boundaries of what can be done. Like most things it can be used for good or bad, but the vast majority of hackers I’ve met tend to be idealistic people who want to have a positive impact on the world.

![](https://cl.ly/3E0R0302063Q/TNC_The_HACKER_WAY.jpg)

The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it — often in the face of people who say it’s impossible or are content with the status quo.

> The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

> * Aware, like a fox crossing the water.

> * Alert, like a general on the battlefield. 

> * Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests. 

> * Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood. 

> * Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

> Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds? The answer exists only in Tao.

And if you've ever interacted with a gifted electrical engineer or programmer then you know there's a certain nerd swagger that the really good ones have. It's hard to describe. Seeing their work can make you buckle and want to quit trying. And when you find out they make as much as doctors, wear flip-flops to work and are so well pampered, you begin to wonder if you can hack too.

While this all sounds gravy, there is one thing you should note: Most of these gurus have been putting in work since they were ~12 years old. Mr. Gladwell would say you need to put 10,000 quality hours in before you become a master, and we agree, somewhat. Woah, that's still a lot of time spent on the computer geeking out!

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4PAAqHUEAAD-JQ.jpg:large)

What Malcom G. doesn't tell you is how to spend those hours. And if you're older, you're not out necessarily, but you certainly can't waste anymore time. That's where this book comes into play. Gamifyed Inc. is quickly establishing itself as a Holacratic Academy for people at all stages of the game. We're like the scouts but for hacking, driven with purpose, enthralled by the potential upside of it all. We're here to make sure you spend all your time learning as efficiently as possible. We try and keep you away from things that aren't worth learning also, because trust us, there's a lot of gunk out there NOT worth learning.

But why do 'hackers' really do what they do? What is it that's so powerful that it can make a man or woman sit for thousands of hours infront of complex code or slave away on microscopic circuits? 

For now, let's just say that there's a secret understanding that the A+ ones have.

> Under the guise of a secret lingo, we level-up on the praise of a thousands of Github stars. Elit3's from all over the planet contribute to our source as our scripts form like Voltron and our whips go fast as hell. 

At MIT, they sometimes refer to all this jargon as the Tao of Programming and at Facebook it's known as 'The Hacker Way.' It's the stuff a lot of people just don't get. Only a small handfull of people are actually a part of it.

For now, all you need to do is be prepared to predict outcomes, stretch your imagination and slay your first dragon. Ok not real dragons but huge metaphorical ones with names like Moores Law and the Big O Notation. 

# Becoming an elit3.

Gamifyed is here to teach you newbs the proper lingo, culture and the hacker way. There might even be something in it for the gods. Within minutes of picking up this book you'll understand. This isn't just some comic book stuffed with buzzwords and cool sounding acronyms, it's a cheat sheet with young bucks riffing about pointers and voltage, arguing over code patterns and memory leaks. *And it's a comic book! What's not to love?* 

If you're a fast learner you'll pick up on quite a bit. Each page acts as a map. Each project serves as a piece of a larger puzzle. And if you hammer through the highly technical QR code crap, you might just establish your nerd-cred on topics ranging from AI algorithms to circuitry and math-ops on the data your sensors produce. Best of all you'll witness everything through the eyes (and over the shoulder) of the youngest, most elit3 hacker in the world, Gou Sokyeo. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917321/gou2.jpg)

Yezzir. We're talking about diving right into some of the most intenese, vivid real-life hacker culture on the planet - that most can't even relate to.

Calm down though, Rome wasn't built in a day. What you need to realize is that from time to time, if you consistently pick up this book and flip through the pages, read it, ponder it and master a tutorial here and there, you'll eventually crack the books code. And on that day you'll realize one thing, *you're getting there.*

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917335/gou5.jpg)

The minute you begin to emulate Gou's traits will forever be the moment that you become an elit3 hacker worthy of a job at any company you wish. And with that you'll have the power to design a life however so you dream.

And when that day comes you'll still find new and exciting stuff to conquer; there will always be a new mission to complete, a invention to launch and a cause worth fighting for. It's what keeps even the most fascinating tech billionaires on the planet going, working harder than anyone else they know - it's because they know that *everything* is possible.

![](https://cl.ly/451Y2j3i1z23/tnc_cover.jpg)

# How it all begins.

Gou Sokyeo and his powerful network of family and friends will be right by your side to help mentor you and keep two steps ahead of the rest. 

While he might not tell you all the time, Gou truly wants you to succeed, but you'll have to earn his respect for that to happen. He's got very little time for bullcrud so you'll have to read between the lines at times. Gou expects you to pick up on things that aren't always obvious, just like your future colleagues will do. Gou expects you to become resourceful. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917324/gou3.jpg)

As a reader you'll dive into the dozens of full life-cycle projects and as you do, pay attention to the situations, opportunities and failures that led to the outcome. If you become enlightened, you'll find out that from Nikola Tesla's discovery of alternating current, to the invention of the Turing Machine and even Twitter, generating you're own luck is what's it's really all about. 

![](https://cl.ly/1b2M0p1m2Y2Q/tnc_5.jpg)

So if you'd someday like to be the one to discover the next new critical API or create the next scientific sensor with universal implications, you'll need to develop some basic instincts first.

![](https://cl.ly/3O470Q2j172y/NC_03_300_Color.jpg)

> The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

Gou will quickly help you get up to speed but the rest is up to you, so get ready to own it.

## About the projects.

The Node Chronicles starts off with a deep dive into the PI Zero (and later the Arduino). The protagonist, Gou Sokyeo examines some critical use cases of these tiny boards while he offers an inpsiring tour of some of the coolest new inventions using them. 

When you follow the QR codes in the book you'll have the opportunity to work on each of the projects and sometimes even link-up with the elit3 mods to demonstrate your progress. If you flip open your laptop or bust out your tablet can even simulate the wiring-up of your first components in 3D! 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2910719/setup.jpg)

Reading about Gou and his network illuminates the common traits the MIT bound Taoist hacker. His work ethic, mindset and personal values are in many ways what lead him to his major breakthroughs. And his life isn't always easy. Things don't always go smooth, as they won't for you at some point. Rest assured the 'network' will embrace you.

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917331/gou4.jpg)

And just so you know, Gou is by all means the youngest, most elit3 hacker on the planet and there are clear reasons why. By now, his personal network is one of the most promising EECS communities on the planet. 

By picking up this book you have just entered into a community where elit3 mods at every major university back Gou up on Github and in IRC. They quickly flock to aid his open source initatives and he's never more than an instant away from other elit3's that can help him solve any problem. You will soon find out if you have what it means to be a part of that community.

So if you think you have what it takes to design your own hardware components, programmatically divide sensor data and write servers to power some of the most sophisticated electrical computing devices on the planet,* get going*. Go to chapter one and get started!

# Working with the hardware.

To take this all one step further, we've decided to create a physical companion package to go along with the entire book. After all, what good is reading about all this stuff if you've never actually rolled up your sleeves and got your hands dirty?

If you begin reding this book and decide this stuff is worth pursuing, definitely grab one of our expansion packs. Each expansion pack has a deck of circuitry cards and a deck of inspiration cards. Together these cards will help you wire up fundamental circuits and gadgets which eventually can be mixed and matched to create your own concepts.

# One last bit on hacking.

For those of you parents and educators still wondering exactly what we mean by 'hacking,' I'll just say this: First, kids are intrigued by the word (whatever it means) and second, hacking is what is considered, dare I say, a new and very real super power - it can be used to perform cyber-crime or to work legitimate wonders. With that power comes great responsibility.

> Millennials and Generation Z want honesty, transparency and opportunity so I decided to use it.

Last year UCLA hosted one of the largest "HACK-A-THONS" in the country, LA Hacks. Ultimately, it's the 'how the heck did you just glitch that' reaction that hackers thrive on. More than a thousand students got together in small squads to hack on some insanely cool, spur of the moment stuff, like automonous docking drones and breakthrough machine learning algorithms. After three nights spent in the gym, the entire stadium ended up completely packed as the finalists presented on stage.

![](https://cl.ly/1Y100z152k3O/lahacks.jpg)

I'm confronted constantly by people who say not to use the term as it will confused parents and teachers into thinking it's a book about illegal activity. The problem is those same people have never even heard of a hackathon or know very little about the industry. They're somewhat outdated.

And when you see a job ad for a JavaScript hacker or read about the 10 year old finnish kid who was given a $10,000 bug bounty for hacking Instagram, you begin to realize 'hacking' is a fundamental ability. 

Some even argue that Tesla was hacking electricity and Edisons DC empire when he pioneered alternating current. Alan Turing was legitimately cracking the enigma when he discovered the modern computer's fundamental main algorithm, the Turing/State Machine. 

![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/104173/screenshots/2917317/turing.jpg)

And like so many other scientists, mathmeticians and invetors before him, he was messed with, persecuted and criticized for his work and his personal life - to the extent it ruined his life. While society is much more accepting today, there are still many dangers inventors and entreprenours face. Using a vast historical perspective, we tend to speak on politics quite a bit.

> Hacking is just a skill, like marksmanship.  If somebody is an expert marksman, and they only shoot targets in safe, controlled environment then he's not 'bad'.  If instead that marksman uses his skill to shoot a dozen innocent people at a movie theatre, then he's bad. It's not the skill that made him good or bad.  It's what he did with the skill. 

Those using their ability to hack to commit illegal and immoral acts are NEVER championed by The Node Chronicles. In-fact, we even confront them and the aspects of being in control of your decisions and future quite a bit. In the book at some point we draw a clear line in the sand about what's right and wrong when it comes to hacking. 

In a nutshell, hacking is a skill that the world needs more of (the good kind of course).

# Teaching isn't just about memorization.

Gamifyed is a new company exploring an expiramental new transmedia method of teaching. Our initial barriers in convincing young teens to willingly spend time on this we're unsettling. What we ultimately found is that they need new forms of motivation to break the barrier. Suffice it to say, *we've been obsessed with figuring this out.*

We've done tons of formal research on 'why gifted hackers spend such huge amounts of time learning, exploiting and tampering with technology.' We looked carefully at the moments when hackers had their first 'aha moments' and when they 'just knew they could code.' We like to think our findings have been incorporated into every picture, facial expression, text and QR code in the book.

Throughout this process, we've also found that *being able to leverage the graphic novel format* completely unshackles us from what the traditional text book has to offer. And we believe that some day 3D games on conosoles or VR platforms will add to this. These new age mediums some day play a much greater role in the rapid onset of deep tech education. 

In the future, we plan to investigate this idea thoroughly. Having a graphic novel foundation with a full cast and concept puts us in the unique position to actually develop such new experiences some day.

To dabble in this, we sometimes setup tests with kids to measure how they learn when using different forms of media. Given the same content on paper in text form, graphic form and as a story-mode in a game, we observed that in graphic and espeically animated game form, not only was retention of information higher, but that kids were more likely to want to continue on. 

![](https://cl.ly/19422M2f0v3o/designing_frankie.jpg)

Next to that we discovered full color, rich graphics combined with storyform content, no matter whether in print or in storymode, was more than twice as impactful on the learner.

![](https://cl.ly/080Q0I1G1y21/non_reading.jpg)

The field of ECE is expanding rapidly and includes a combination of EE, CS and Software Engineering. Our 'GISTT' graphic textbook covers these fields in an way that continuously praises the well grounded engineerist for his theoretical thought process and simulatanious knowledge of the business and strategies many have used to successfully launch their products. 

![](https://cl.ly/3o3n003Q0d35/tnc_8.jpg)

If we as a company were to coin an acronym for the phenomenom we're pioneering, we'd call it: Graphicly Interactive Storytelling Transmedia Textbook or GISTT. But before we go and throw that term around, know that we're still just figuring all this out. Whether or not the classroom is meant to feel more like Disney or Marvel or an immersive video gaming experience has yet to be proven. One can only speculate right now and you the reader will have to keep us informed.

![](https://cl.ly/0e2R282i2L3d/tnc_6.jpg)

# Young prodigies.

In general, prodigies are becoming the new norm within the American household and the stereotypes are narrowing. Yes, there are some stereotypes about hackers. It isn't just geeky boys learning to code anymore it's sweet, normal little girls who are good at math and football playing class presidents who want to change the world. It's transcended across every continent, skintone and background, so long as you have a computer, internet and proper context. 

What we do know is that our user research over the past two years has consistently demonstrated that young masters of success latch onto vivid context. Girls obsessed with watching professional athletes on YouTube teach themselves new techniques and become prodigies. Boys inspired by talented singers on Television watch and listen to clips over and over. Young children with the patience and warewithall to sit and do art for hours upon consecutive hours become great classical artists, and so on. There isn't just one factor that consistently produces prodigies, *which is why we examine several.*

![](https://cl.ly/3o2r0t0v2934/tnc_lilu.jpg)

The idea that your child has other options besides just sports or music has never been more present. The notion that you could become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Sergay Brin has become evident by the number of unicorns surfacing all of the World. Teens are literally building things in their basements that go online and become worth millions of dollars. 

![](https://cl.ly/272Y2L370j2n/tnc_2.jpg)

# Proof of concept.

The Node Chronicles attempts to be what Thrasher magazine was to skateboarding in the 80's and 90's - a movement which led to the exponential motivation and advancement of the sport. Today's professional skateboarders are doing unthinkable things because of Thrashers ability to steadily capture the industry at any given moment and make others fall inlove with the culture.

The show Mr. Robot and The Silicon Valley recently highlighted that television could be combined with reasonably accurate technical content to create a show loved by millions while being cultishly coveted by an entire industry. Fans of these shows who code or do start-ups love one thing, that they are somewhat accurate on the technical content. Millions more are even more fascinated who know less about the field and it's because the field is filled with excitement, danger, risk, betrayal and tons of other concerns. A media scan at any given moment is all you need to find inspiration for this sort of action. 

The fact is that each day, thousands of elit3's out there write incredibly amazing tutorials with simply the hopes of passing down their trade. Gamifyed ultimately wants to be the ones curating this stuff on more than just a blog. We also feel that this stuff all needs to fit it more of a classical context. 

When reading this book from cover-to-cover, in just under a couple hours, you'll walk away with a sense of accomplishment, a new vocabulary and theoretical base of knowledge that's well worth the $75 dollars. You'll also have a much better knowledge of how all these pieces fit together and in what order you should learn them.

### *Excerpts and Random Facts*

The Node Chronicles is pushing a similar boundary in American education. With more than 250 schools already analyzing this for their classrooms and 2500 books sold, the user feedback we've gotten can be grouped into three important statistics about this book.

250 teachers representing close to 250 schools purchased the book unaware that they were part of a survey. Each were shipped the first edition and given a month to analyze the book. After the first month they were given a survey. Of the 250 surveys sent, 226 responded within a week. 

96% of the respondands answered three simple questions .

* How likely are you to push to make this required reading for your STEM program?

* How likely are you to recommend this to parents interested in their kids learning about electronics, coding and computer engineering?

* How likely are you to purchase more products from us in the future?
 
**Here were the results of the survey. **

-- READERS, SKIP to preface. This parts bullshart....

In 2017, Gamifyed will continue to invest in it's vision to become the leading cultural curator for classrooms and homes where ECE is quickly becoming a top priority. With 50 billion IoT Devices to come online by the year 2020 and each field is becoming an information technology field, the prospect of a new "academy" style cultural movement for kids and teenagers could be huge. 

The Node Chronicles is the first real, American born, globally relevant graphic novel based on the fascinating tech culture, with historical references to pioneers and their personal situations ranging from and Alan Turing to Bill Gates and Massimo Banzi. 

We've found that those proceeding with this book quickly have others take note to their accomplishments and that quickly establishes the necssary warewithall needed to become addicted and learn more. If you're following Gou's lead, you'll want to keep doing it more and more until the stuff just oozes from you, until you sweat in binary and learn to co-exist as if a quibit. 

If you listen to Gou for me, I promise you one day it will just hit you. Bam. You'll wake up and realize you're not a newb anymore and that others will completely respect you for your hacking chops. Your friends jaws will drop as they watch you earn cold hard cash coding from your dorm room. They'll admire your ability to build anything you can fathom and soon enough, you'll become what's known as an guru or an elit3.

While other economies around the world lead in manufacturing and even education, America is typically known for their innovation. We also happen to be the leading contributors to the open source movement by a landslide.

### *Volume 1*

NOTE TO EARLY READERS: 

We are open sourcing the core of our curriculum, make no mistake of that. Any attempt to make money by charging for our products at this stage of the game is simply to fund what we do. This will never change. In other words, there will be pull requests to this document.

With that said please wait for instruction on contributing. We will announce an open activity for all those interested in contributing to our underlying research and knowledge base. We respect a wide variety of motives for advising or contributing, so please get in touch with Frank@fye2.com if interested. 

Please also consider there are many factors that go into this type of project. This document is slowly being updated and we appreciate you're patience. 

## **PREFACE**

To be the king, one has to know he is the king:

The life in front of us is a scrambled pattern of mostly other peoples ideas, some of them good, some of them bad. To navigate the tech jungle the mind must be sharp like a machete. The Gamifyed group of core contributors think about one thing and one thing only, how to streamline the information we see ahead; we fight to pave the path infront of the next generation. 

This is the **missing curriculum** people! Your kids are going to read some of it, all of it, or heck maybe just look at the pics. You will read parts, maybe all of it, and some will go an even step further and investigate the ideas and links we've put in the book and find that this is a book of modern magic we sometimes call hacking. Not black, not white, perhaps gray, sometimes for profit and possibly even risky. 

> Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

**BOOK PREFACE**

What started as a simple experiment with fundamentals and graphic content has now become a globally recognized platform embraced by teachers, parents and young innovators everywhere.

It's been 3 years since that first test and research become much more forensic. Does a newb (or even an adult) retain information differently with this format? Does this format help draw kids in over their other devices? How exactly should we layer in complexity for the different age groups? 

Gamifyed is the first mover to go full-speed ahead with this idea. With the help of former Marvel artists, DC writers and top ECE practitioners our goal is to genuinely inspire and teach young readers using a carefully stitched together technical literature, tutorials, action, movement, suspense, drama, politics, hardships and real-world scenarios. Gamifyed wants this to be the book you can't put down; the path to some serious techno enlightenment, a segway to some serious hacking abilities.

Passing down a careful blend of must know topics tied to dramatic situations is what makes this format so unique to me. I can do with it what regular text books have never been able to and I can re-create these moments with intense illustrations and action. Major textbook publishers would never dare mix controversial values, deep politics and grit with learning - let alone comic books. And I don't disagree. School isn't a place for super off topic, experimental indy written content by enlarge. But the general curriculum also isn't a place for developing prodigies now is it?

And that's what this book is really about: the 'missing curriculum - it's about not letting our kids get any older without understanding certain things and what it means to be equipped with the power of ECE. The young mind is powerful, kids exhibit extreme memory and learning capabilities when they play video games or sports.

So I digress; If you're looking for something less gritty, try Kano or the Manga Guides. If you're looking for something seriously hardcore that's built from the ground up with careful research, something that can genuinely build a real interest, choose Gamifyed and The Node Chronicles. 


** Target Audience**

The simple answer is 9 to 19 year olds. PLTW Info....

The more complicated answer is: almost everything Gou and his friends demonstrate in this book can be repeated by the reader. The book features a ton of QR code code extended content, open source code snippets and a flagship feature, expansion packs. Expansion Packs are physical kits that go along with each chapter.
