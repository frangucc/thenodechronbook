 ## VIDEO SCRIPT

**PARITY**

What makes video games as a teaching tool so perfect is the teachers ability to customize content and how quickly we can receive input and adapt. When you mix custom graphics, computers and gamification, you get an entertaining simulation. 

To teach complex subjects learners need to consistently practice. Keeping it entertaining is easier said than done but when you get it right, it's extremely powerful.

I don't think we've ever seen an game this modern and intentional about teaching science - we've brought together the best talent in the world to create this. We're keeping a close watch on 

Need a song like this but not about some crazy relationship but about a diverse group of kids smiles on faces in tight action groups with lots of technology lighting up their faces - some exceptional branding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AOtEnH87Mg

## GARBAGE EXTRA WRITING

> Make me laugh. Make me cry. Tell me my place in the world. Lift me out of my skin and place me in another. Show me places I have never visited and carry me to the ends of time and space. Give my demons names and help me confront them. Demonstrate for me possibilities I've never thought of and present me with heroes who will give me courage and hope. Ease my sorrows and increase my joy. Teach me compassion. Entertain and enchant and enlighten me.  Tell me a story. 


Almost everything Gou and his friends demonstrate in this book can be repeated by the reader. The book features a ton of QR code code extended content, open source code snippets and a flagship feature, expansion packs. Expansion Packs are physical kits that go along with each chapter. The goal is to offer reasonably priced, a la carte hardware packs to give readers the real-world hands on experience they need to succeed in this field. In the tech industry, it's all about what you have done and demonstrating tangible abilities - so let's not be hasty here. 

While many say it can't be done, I believe there's a ton of resistence for readers of all ages and levels. And we take great pride in our quality assurance process, so part of our goal is to impress the buffs. All of the tutorials are guaranteed to work or be supported or my name is mud.


Overall, as the author, I try to keep the cast relatively neutral on certain world views but that doesn't mean they aren't addressed. The best I can do is demonstrate that the good cast members have sophisticated conciouses with complex reasoning abilities while others make poor decisions and suffer. 

At the end of the day this isn't me taking my chance at corrupting your kids. This is about me doing what I felt I had to do to get my own childrens attention and formatting it in a way that I believe could make a huge difference in getting kids at younger ages to adopt.

The truth is that 8 out of 10 kids under 15 in this country would much rather be playing or socializing than studying computers. I find this problem to be an opportunity to try something bold and new.  I see it as an opportunity to hijack the things they love to teach them things they should know. Tactically, I see it as a way to help them memorize things by association to realistic situations in life they already are exposed to.

The dramatic or edgy situations and dialogue are meant to keep you're kids interested for their own good. They are sometimes used to anchor important concepts or even break up the monotony of complexity. ECE is one of the most complex fields known to man. Paradoxically, once you understand the hard parts, it becomes second nature and the sky is the limit. 

The moral of the story is that there are consequences to everything you do, even in science and engineering, a field that should be free of peril. Keeping quiet about your business and remain humble until you're proven is always a good thing. [Just take the Tao of Programming for example](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjk26HEscbLAhXInIMKHSa2C2wQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mit.edu%2F~xela%2Ftao.html&usg=AFQjCNEUxXeIMdY1u9TUk4LmKS3T3CoMNA&sig2=IStx6t9GxRo-INzO4wU2ug), the 5 page essay almost all MIT students read. It's a book of wisdom on how to handle pressure, stress, anxiety, horrible bosses and so forth. 

Having a moral compass is mandatory if you want to lead others and knowing who to trust is essential when capitalizing on breakthrough technology. Working hard is vital and powering through with extreme levels of warewithall are the only way you'll succeed in this industry. At the end of the day, these are the fundamentals I believe in personally and want to communicate through my writing.

We've all heard the story about the programmer who wrote his first program on his TI 85 or hacked into his highschool network and changed their grades - but that's all BS in my opinion. What we don't hear are the more intimate stories about how ones parents or sibling influenced them at a young age, specifically - or what particular moments sparked real breakthroughs in learning to code or mastering circuitry. 

The most important takeaway from my teams researh interviewing hundreds of kids, parents and accomplished industry professionals is that great STEM majors ultimately will attribute their aha moments and milestones in learning to something much deeper; certain memories in their early life or areas they got stuck that they wish they could have punched through on sooner. For homes that lack this rich early life culture, The Node Chronicles is here to provide them. 

Individual innovators have been screwed over by vulture capitalists and snakes since the beginning of time. Their ideas are stolen, patents infringed, employees go rogue, the powers that be are always stepping in exhibiting their greed and will to control the industry. At the same time, the venture capitalists are essential. And the discoragers that beat you down only make you tougher. So in the end, we also need to teach how to navigate these waters with the help of good mentors, advisors and resources is what makes some engineers successful and others so mundane. 


GARBAGE ASS FLUFF FOR DORKY READERS

The planet is in trouble for real this time and it's time for all you people to become the real super heros. Yes I am being serious; you, the people this time are being called upon by the planet to save yourself, find a way out and seek higher ground. 

Urban agriculture is going to be essential if you don't want to be eating fruit with radiation from Fukishima. And we certainly are going to need to study marine biology more closely if we don't plan on watching our oceans die. Africa could be the next healthy continent while America becomes unlivable due to pollution. The days of pencil pushing are over.

So if we can send our kids to karate class at age five to chop wood with their hands and force them to play soccer at age 3, then we damn sure can teach a little literacy in the science of how things work. And quit calling us nerds and geeks. We are chidlren of the planet who might one day help save our families or this planet, much in the way Mark Watney survives on Mars in The Martian. We have more important hobbys that might some day help save this planet. 

With a little shot of discipline you're kids will get excited about doing this and they will take to it just as they do the two very Xtramath or StudyIsland (two mediocre gamifyed online programs many teachers prescribe that most kids don't mind). 



"Hackers" that go around MMORPGs are called "script kiddies"... they download scripts usually written by people with little knowledge about systems but enough to get a basic task done, i.e. Unity 3D games nearly always have the same exploits, because they are designed with the same libraries and the 3 or 4 scripts out there to hack Unity games are just barely modified by one scripter, and they claim they "hacked" the game (usually as easy as changing a port number).

Script kiddies make up the majority of people that call themselves hackers.

## On Hackers

Hackers have always felt the term meant this innocent sort of "respectful exploration and experimentation" with life, but the media has had to play catch up to bring their definition into allignment, they still have some ways to go in fact.

I think this largely originated from crackers and people committing cyber crime claiming to be hackers in order to downplay what they were doing, or reason it as "for good", and since the media had no idea what that meant, they just went with it. After years of reports of "a hacker broke into ABC bank" people took it to mean something bad.

People who break into things are in fact cracking, not hacking, and the definition goes all the way back to when I was a child in the early 80s and before.


ABOUT CARDS and MACRO + MICRO AXIOMS...

#### SECTIONS 1.1-1.18 (the MicroAxioms Part 1)

**Examples**

CARD(*Velocity)

CARD(*Nyquist-Shannon)

[TODO: COMPLETE ALL 40 CARDS]



### There are 5 macro axioms covered in TNC-V1 and ~40 micro axioms.

These notes are cra. These notes were captured by iPhone dictation in the app Notes. They are in RAW form. 

What was a methodology born out of necessity trying to create this holy grail of a concept is quickly becoming an organizational algorithm based on 20 uniquely fundamental sensor circuits (macro axioms) x 20 pieces of scientific inspiration (micro axioms). Divided amongst 5 significant projects, they may also be mix and matched to create . This sort of curation without any physical abstraction to the parts available on the market makes us more market centric than the toys out there like little bits, and with a storyline, we can offer an academy program. This framework gives the overall package a powerful sense of belonging in an environment where there is so so so so much. I've kept my tests short and sweet with users, I've administered the cards and reading materials, I've studied the learners in my target demographic and this is by far different from what they expect and the format gives me a complete engagement that I can easily build from. The idea that you could obtain the correct pieces of such and exciting industry by hijacking the portion of your brain that likes to follow stories is like latching onto the Underground Railroad to becoming a hacker in a short period of time; having a storyline is a hack in and of itself. The books research generated a deck of 20x20 playing cards as a complete byproduct, and that's the moment I knew how the gamification of my company would play out. It also marks a method of mnemonics unlike anything found in traditional programming education, it's like the 3rd dimension of teaching EECS. There is a fierce competition for the shelf space of the maker space and I'm about to get in where I fit in.

The note clinical starts off with a story of go and no one in the basement doing some secret stuff and they are alerted by the presence of their nanny Houze entered into that their area and they've been keeping track of movements around the house using video devices sonar and even a gyroscope which are gyros phone which can detect movement around the house go ahead essentially created using a bunch of different sensors a dashboard on his computer and it makes no very basic display of what's going on from that activity is able to listen and how Rob



The next project is with sideways from that into him where is Lilo and they discover that lever is out in the backyard playing with a drone that go so to put together that she's been taught was taught how to make the drone and packet herself and she does so with a small drone. And a remote control in the book makes reference to hacking up an Xbox remote they use a very basic controller so far in the first few examples that I've given you a ready touched on a video camera microphone Gyro phonesonar we worked on getting that data wires wirelessly over a network into a computer for storage and for graphical representation so that's a pretty big project the next project by the time we get into the drone we're dealing with remote receiving we're dealing with motors servos and him all the things related



So my challenge is to take all of these chapters obviously and pick apart each of the underlying fundamentals circuits and components that are required thus far to tell this whole story moving on the third major project section has to probably do with environmental data they're putting bobbers together and that can send back information about about the environment so the next series of projects are about the floating bobber projects out in the wild and how a device is created to work in nature and work with all things nature and would like to explore hear some something with bio sells tigers some sort of an environmental climate oxygen carbon some sort of data that can be in the environment that would make the third major groupings of product



Know if we were to take a completely different approach and try to retrofit the 20 $.20 or trading cards and into the book we find that they're all covered and so between these three stories and see how everything from getting help doctor and visualization fit machine learning algorithms physical sensors AC/DC did you know Bluetooth Wi-Fi sonar video sound earth movement pattern recognition and then I think the fourth and final project should be about sports and tracking data so you can see from the first project also how we track data using those earlier devices and then will start to see how later were able to get data from different unique places not just from within the home and not just within their first grouping of sensors I'm going to start to work with more you need sensors gradually that involve more math and more circuits and so if you were to take the $.20 or trading cards and mix and match them you find that you'd be able to complete the remote drone project the home security project the environmental barber project and the sports data



There are now many projects that have everything to do with drones and cheap quad copters RC quad potters there Arduino or trinket base you have many accelerator and gyroscope style motion celebration type projects we need in the physics and data analysis data science I'm in start to learn about bio-mechanics team dynamics motion on the field all that stuff so Space from an inter-from a sports field perspective you're getting physics sports fitness heart rate therapy training and you're creating superhuman athletes



With the home security project you're getting this voice sound movement awareness Brysons vibration video film machine learning some security networks transfer and all those things



With the drone project you're getting motors remote remote-controlled physics flight aerodynamics modeling design real-time communications streaming protocol physics all things you want to know about building a barn capsulated Mediport



When you have The environmental bobber node project is where you have found sampling you have some sort of possible actuator in capturing capturing data environment carbon oxygen if there's a cell project to view cells so I want to chip temperature in any other types of sensors if we can make a pH if we can make some experiment that captures the state of environment



We need to look up that project a little bit further but looking to any environmental biological environment type projects and then with in the sports we have movements Celeron mayors gyroscopes bio tracking file for Mattix medicine training but there's a specific technology is involved in heart rate so then possibly the last final major project for fifth project could be satellite satellite and what needs to happen is you need to have five buckets five major projects that require the sensors listed the basic circuits that go along with each of those projects and then from the basic circuits the fundamental concepts in the fundamental pieces of technology need to be broken into



For example with a drone project we need to take a breakdown of a drone tutorial and all the major circuitry and technology concepts Inc. and encapsulate them each into their own semantic grouping whether it's the math component for the streaming componentor the motors are the frequencies and whatever else every device has to be a smart device that is created worked with meaning that he gets his remote-control a drone drone has to be sending back ETA back to the device and it has to be interacting with that data so or capturing footage or something but I would like to see each project be extremely neat



With a saddle a project I would assume we would work with some of the fundamental laws of nature such as morris code radio transmission satellite transmission and if there's anyway we can hack you know NASA with a basic project that would create some sort of satellite communications is it in the most manual rudimentary way how does projects also require power



They require a board and we know or a smaller version processing and you know those things so I would say that there are at least 20 inspirational cards which can represent a fundamental are use or ferry or power power law and then there are 20 and you also want to be able to own every inspiration card and when you completed all 20 circuits we could essentially go back and mix-and-match inspirational cards to inspire new ideas in mixed me know I'm trying to think these things all be incorporated into the book so



The very next most crucial step forward in the five is to pick these 20 x 20 cards parentheses 20 x 20 cards as an exercise and then begin to Houston into projects so for now I'm going to get new parts and find the mall and begin to make sure they have a place near pier in a very distinct order and that each icon and symbol for each characteristic or fundamental power principle is set in space within the graphic novel each when I lay out these inspiration in the deck of cards that comes with the graphic novel I'll be able to retrofit the stories around that next and then the QR codes and then everything else should be able to finish



Now that I am confident of exactly how this all has to be put together exactly how I'm going to do it I should be able to backfill the stories around each card in the round need to ration and continue to tell the story around it but the QR codes in place and wrap up the screen play

PAGE 11 & 12 [PROPERTY & BASEMENT INTRO]


![](https://cl.ly/3H2x0X10460z/NC_06_v2_72.jpg)

* **1 CAP:** Thus 'stealth mode' was their only option; Tesla, Turing and the hundreds of pioneers who came before Gou Sokeyo paid the ultimate sacrafices, their inventions forwarded and eventually, even their lives were lost. Human greed and lust for power will never change; there's always a snake in the grass waiting to strike. 

* **2 CAP:** For the two boys and their sister Lilu, why their father bought the old Frank Lloyd Wright house has and will always be a mystery. Vero their caretaker says it was a bad investment their father Chino made just before he cracked up and quit working. 

* **3 CAP:** Tucked away hidden down in the back of a prohibition era basement exists one of todays greatest young hackers. Frightened more than by any, his father hasn't the slightest clue what he's up to downstairs, for if he had, he would "KILL HIM."

> **PANEL ONE** - THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF REVEALING SHOTS GOING FROM FAR TO NEAR OF GOU AND NON IN THEIR HIGHLY SECRETIVE BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS. BEHIND THE STAIRCASE AND AROUND THE BEND OF THE LARGE BASEMENT ROOM, A WALL FILLED WITH STORED STUFF EMERGES. DOZES OF HUGE BOXES STACKED TO THE CEILING REVEALSE GLIMSES OF LIGHT FROM THE CRACKS WHERE THE EDGES OF EACH BOX MEET, RESEMBLING THE OUTLINE OF A DOOR BEHIND THE BOXES. THE BOYS HAVE MASKED AN ENTIRE WALL WITH A DOOR AS IF THE BASEMENT ENDED RIGHT THERE (THE LIGHT IS ONLY ON BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THERE WORKING). WHEN THE CORRECT BOX IS MOVED, A HOLE LEADS TO A DOOR, WHICH ONCE ENTERED OPENS UP INTO GOU'S SECRET BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS (BHQ). IT'S HOW THEY GET IN AND OUT. ONLY THE TWO BROTHERS AT THIS POINT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE. SEE REFERENCES OF WHAT THIS BASEMENT COULD LOOK LIKE BELOW.

![](https://cl.ly/1J221G2v2z2h/NC_06_72.jpg)

FRANK TODO: Add references to this scene about the green mill, al capones old hideouts, pathways to city hall - this interesting place could be the underground railroad in Chicago.

The general idea of the 10th and 11th page is that it's the opening to the setting. Zoom from afar to see the big home and what the landscape looks like. Zoom into see the ornate brickwork of the old politicians small mansion in Garfield Park. Get into the basement, which rumor has it was once connected to Al Capones underground railroad system and that you could get to city hall and the green mill from the basement tunnels. Just at the foot of the tunnel is the last room which is the only access to the tunnel. This is where Gou and Non have setup shop. The room is blocked off by a bunch of old boxes, Lily, Chino and Vero have no idea it's there. 

> **PANEL TWO** - CLOSER REVEAL OF THE TWO BOYS WORKING OUT OF GOU'S STEALTH MODE HEADQUARTERS...

![](https://cl.ly/2R2b351z2U2C/NC_08_72.jpg)

* **2 CAP:** Tis not without strife Gou secretly develops his innovations in stealth mode, for his father Chino does not want him to follow in his footsteps. [Add much more cleverness to this caption: As in the days of yester the top inventors, for whatever reasons, worked in stealth mode. Stuff about copycats, greedy companies and politicians are always searching for the next big thing and they lack their own creativity to invent them.]

> **PANEL THREE** - EVEN CLOSER... UNTIL WE GET RIGHT UP BEHIND THEM AND SEE WHAT GOU'S WORKSTATION AND SETUP LOOKS LIKE. OFF AND AROUND THE AREA ARE PALETS OF OLD PC'S COVERED IN TARPS AND STACKS OF OLD PC POWER SUPPLIES THAT GOU HAPPENS TO BE SALVAGING FOR SOME REASON. THE COMPUTER SCREENS HAVE GECKOBOARDS AND GOU IS CLEARLY MONITORING EVERYTING FROM LATEST BITCOIN STOCK PRICES TO SECURITY CAMERAS AROUND THE PROPERTY. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IT'S THE START OF A CIA LIKE HEADQUARTER HACKER OPERATION AND THAT THERE IS A TON OF ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

* **3 CAP:** It's no secret that the worlds greatest inventors, from Davinici to Einstein kept their inventions a secret until they were ready. 

* **4 CAP:** By banning Gou from hacking on code and hardware, his father Chino had inadvertently created one of the youngest stealth mode hackers on the planet.

PAGE 13

> **PANEL ONE** - FULL PAGE PANEL. GOU IS FIXATED ON A HIGHLY EXPIRAMENTAL PROJECT WHICH HE DOESN'T QUITE SHARE WITH THE READER YET (SPOILER ALERT, IT'S THE NODE). GOU'S TAKING A HUGE RISK BY DOING THIS IN HIS BASEMENT, AS HE'S BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HACK ON COMPUTERS BY HIS FATHER. NON COULD GET IN TROUBLE JUST FOR BEING AROUND GOU IT'S THAT DANGEROUS. AND WHILE TOTALLY CHILL MOST OF THE TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF CHINO, THEIR FATHER. IN THIS PANEL, WE SEE A CLOSEUP OF GOU'S FACE AND NODE.

* **1 CAP:** Swarn to be a normal boy and not to get caught up in computers and technology, Gou Sokyeo taught himself the art of electrical computer engineering against his fathers wishes. 


PAGE 14 [SHOWING OFF, GOU & NON FIRST DIALOGUE]

> **PANEL ONE** - FIRST EVER SCENE WITH GOU AND NON, THEY ARE INTRODUCED AS A PAIR, ONLY GOU IS CLEARLY THE LEAD HACKER IN THE FAMILY. NON'S JUGGLING A MINI SOCCER BALL (SIZE 1 FUTSAL BALL). AFTER ABOUT 60 JUGGLES HE SMASHES THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SMASHES AN OLD UNUSED MONITOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE IN. NEXT TO HIM IS ARE SEVERAL STACKS OF OLD POWER SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD PCS. THE PCS ARE IN ANOTHER HUGE PILE, COVERED UP BY A TARP, JUST IN CASE.

* **Sound:** Pap, pap, pap, pap

> **PANEL TWO** - A CLOSE UP OF NONS CAREFUL LOOK AS HE JUGGLES THE BALL COMFORTABLY ON HIS FOOT. PROPER FORM IS KEY TO THIS SHOT. 

* **Sound Continues:** Pap, pap, pap, pap, powwwww-boooot!!!

> **PANEL THREE** - NON GOES FROM A JUGGLE TO A VOLLEY KICK, SHOOTING THE BALL INTO A LINE DRIVE ACROSS THE ROOM THEY ARE IN AND NAILS AN OLD COMPUTER SCREEN AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE NONS DESK (WHICH HE NEVER USES).

* **1 Nōn:** 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, g-g-g-g-goooooallllllla-soooooo

> **PANEL FOUR** - NON DOES A CELEBRATION DANCE, THE RONALDO MOVE, AFTER HE SCORES - HE'S EXAGGERATING AND MAKING A BIG DEAL OF THE SILLY GOAL HE SCORES, AND ISN'T PHASED BY DAMAGING THE SCREEN. 

* **2 Gou:** Will you get outta here with that ball! I'm working!

> **PANEL FIVE** - GOU SHOUTS AT NON.

* **3 Nōn:** Hastag Anger Issues. What's dad got against us messing with technology anyhow? And why are you salvaging old PC power sources? 

``````

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ccluhu_XIAAcV29.jpg:large)

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU RESPONDS TO NON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED ANYMORE AS HE WORKS ON A PART OF THE NODE. HE RESPONDS TO NON VERY CASUALLY, AS IF BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT NON HAS TO SAY. NON IS WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY AND IS CLEARLY MORE OF A JOCK, WHILE GOU IS DRESSED IN HIS BASEMENT HACKER OUTFIT (SEE CHAPTER WARDROBE NOTES BELOWS)

* **3 Gou** I dunno. I think he doesn't want us to grow up to fast... that and I think something happened to him in the industry just before he went on his sabbatical. And I'm replacing the coils with Rodin Coils. Testing something...

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON STOPS BOUNCING THE BALL AS IF HE'S INTENTIONALLY LEFT IT ROLL AWAY AS HE FACES GOU. HE LOOKS CONCERNED AND NERVOUS FOR GOU AS HE TRIES TO WARN HIM. BUT GOU DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE AS CONCERNED.

* **4 Nōn** You know if he catches you down here with all this stuff he's gonna kill you.

> **PANEL EIGHT** - GOU HOLDS UP THE HC-SRO4 SONAR SENSOR AND EXPLAINS TO NON THAT HE'S IMPLEMENTED HIS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM. GOU HOLDS UP THE SENSORS BEFORE NONS EYES BUT NONS NOT AMAZED, RATHER, HE'S SKETPICAL, AS IF TO SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

* **5 Gou** I got eyes and ears on him all the time. You see this sonar sensor? If he even comes near the basement door upstairs I'll know. 

* **5.1 NOTE** Get the HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor expansion pack online and setup your own security system like Gou. 

* **5.2 QR CODE** http://store.gamifyed.com/#/sonar-expansion-pack

* **6 CAP** Disguised as a normal thirteen year old boy, Gou is one of most elite ECE hackers in the world. From his secret basement headquarters in Garfield Park, he takes part in the most innovative programming and engineering projects known to man.
