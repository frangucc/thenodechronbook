 ## VIDEO SCRIPT

**PARITY**

What makes video games as a teaching tool so perfect is the teachers ability to customize content and how quickly we can receive input and adapt. When you mix custom graphics, computers and gamification, you get an entertaining simulation. 

To teach complex subjects learners need to consistently practice. Keeping it entertaining is easier said than done but when you get it right, it's extremely powerful.

I don't think we've ever seen an game this modern and intentional about teaching science - we've brought together the best talent in the world to create this. We're keeping a close watch on 




## GARBAGE EXTRA WRITING

> Make me laugh. Make me cry. Tell me my place in the world. Lift me out of my skin and place me in another. Show me places I have never visited and carry me to the ends of time and space. Give my demons names and help me confront them. Demonstrate for me possibilities I've never thought of and present me with heroes who will give me courage and hope. Ease my sorrows and increase my joy. Teach me compassion. Entertain and enchant and enlighten me.  Tell me a story. 


Almost everything Gou and his friends demonstrate in this book can be repeated by the reader. The book features a ton of QR code code extended content, open source code snippets and a flagship feature, expansion packs. Expansion Packs are physical kits that go along with each chapter. The goal is to offer reasonably priced, a la carte hardware packs to give readers the real-world hands on experience they need to succeed in this field. In the tech industry, it's all about what you have done and demonstrating tangible abilities - so let's not be hasty here. 

While many say it can't be done, I believe there's a ton of resistence for readers of all ages and levels. And we take great pride in our quality assurance process, so part of our goal is to impress the buffs. All of the tutorials are guaranteed to work or be supported or my name is mud.


Overall, as the author, I try to keep the cast relatively neutral on certain world views but that doesn't mean they aren't addressed. The best I can do is demonstrate that the good cast members have sophisticated conciouses with complex reasoning abilities while others make poor decisions and suffer. 

At the end of the day this isn't me taking my chance at corrupting your kids. This is about me doing what I felt I had to do to get my own childrens attention and formatting it in a way that I believe could make a huge difference in getting kids at younger ages to adopt.

The truth is that 8 out of 10 kids under 15 in this country would much rather be playing or socializing than studying computers. I find this problem to be an opportunity to try something bold and new.  I see it as an opportunity to hijack the things they love to teach them things they should know. Tactically, I see it as a way to help them memorize things by association to realistic situations in life they already are exposed to.

The dramatic or edgy situations and dialogue are meant to keep you're kids interested for their own good. They are sometimes used to anchor important concepts or even break up the monotony of complexity. ECE is one of the most complex fields known to man. Paradoxically, once you understand the hard parts, it becomes second nature and the sky is the limit. 

The moral of the story is that there are consequences to everything you do, even in science and engineering, a field that should be free of peril. Keeping quiet about your business and remain humble until you're proven is always a good thing. [Just take the Tao of Programming for example](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjk26HEscbLAhXInIMKHSa2C2wQFggdMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mit.edu%2F~xela%2Ftao.html&usg=AFQjCNEUxXeIMdY1u9TUk4LmKS3T3CoMNA&sig2=IStx6t9GxRo-INzO4wU2ug), the 5 page essay almost all MIT students read. It's a book of wisdom on how to handle pressure, stress, anxiety, horrible bosses and so forth. 

Having a moral compass is mandatory if you want to lead others and knowing who to trust is essential when capitalizing on breakthrough technology. Working hard is vital and powering through with extreme levels of warewithall are the only way you'll succeed in this industry. At the end of the day, these are the fundamentals I believe in personally and want to communicate through my writing.

We've all heard the story about the programmer who wrote his first program on his TI 85 or hacked into his highschool network and changed their grades - but that's all BS in my opinion. What we don't hear are the more intimate stories about how ones parents or sibling influenced them at a young age, specifically - or what particular moments sparked real breakthroughs in learning to code or mastering circuitry. 

The most important takeaway from my teams researh interviewing hundreds of kids, parents and accomplished industry professionals is that great STEM majors ultimately will attribute their aha moments and milestones in learning to something much deeper; certain memories in their early life or areas they got stuck that they wish they could have punched through on sooner. For homes that lack this rich early life culture, The Node Chronicles is here to provide them. 

Individual innovators have been screwed over by vulture capitalists and snakes since the beginning of time. Their ideas are stolen, patents infringed, employees go rogue, the powers that be are always stepping in exhibiting their greed and will to control the industry. At the same time, the venture capitalists are essential. And the discoragers that beat you down only make you tougher. So in the end, we also need to teach how to navigate these waters with the help of good mentors, advisors and resources is what makes some engineers successful and others so mundane.
