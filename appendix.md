## GARBAGE EXTRA WRITING

Almost everything Gou and his friends demonstrate in this book can be repeated by the reader. The book features a ton of QR code code extended content, open source code snippets and a flagship feature, expansion packs. Expansion Packs are physical kits that go along with each chapter. The goal is to offer reasonably priced, a la carte hardware packs to give readers the real-world hands on experience they need to succeed in this field. In the tech industry, it's all about what you have done and demonstrating tangible abilities - so let's not be hasty here. 

While many say it can't be done, I believe there's a ton of resistence for readers of all ages and levels. And we take great pride in our quality assurance process, so part of our goal is to impress the buffs. All of the tutorials are guaranteed to work or be supported or my name is mud.
