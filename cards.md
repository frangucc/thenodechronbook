# Official Cards - ONLY EDIT THIS TABLE.



#20 fundamental sensor circuits (macro axioms) and 20 scientific principals (micro axioms) can be found among these 5 projects

*represented by 5 sections of the first book, The Node Chronicles utilizes transmedia to help mentally organize and memorize 40 total EECS axioms (macro + micro) that when mix and matched are responsible for 80% of all new EECS systems.

This Microaxiom has everything to do with understanding travel, motion and speed.

IMU's
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers.
