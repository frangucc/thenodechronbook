# Official Cards - ONLY EDIT THIS TABLE.

*Can't wait to see these in different colors!

#20 fundamental sensor circuits (macro axioms) and 20 scientific principals (micro axioms) can be found among these 5 projects

*represented by 5 sections of the first book, The Node Chronicles utilizes transmedia to help mentally organize and memorize 40 total EECS axioms (macro + micro) that when mix and matched are responsible for 80% of all new EECS systems.

## CARD(*VELOCITY)

![](https://cl.ly/3l3o1A3h0200/velocity.jpg)


This Microaxiom has everything to do with understanding travel, motion and speed. 

Wheel and linear encoders. (Linear Encoder) -- Far Out.... but cool to talk about as if....

IMU's
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers.
