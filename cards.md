# Official Cards - ONLY EDIT THIS TABLE.

*Can't wait to see these in different colors!

#20 fundamental sensor circuits (macro axioms) and 20 scientific principals (micro axioms) can be found among these 5 projects

*represented by 5 sections of the first book, The Node Chronicles utilizes transmedia to help mentally organize and memorize 40 total EECS axioms (macro + micro) that when mix and matched are responsible for 80% of all new EECS systems.

* Cleaning up of this table is needed as of 9-20-2016
* Must bucket and differentiate between electrical and coding paradigms
* Be sure to introduce these well in every chapter.

IMU's
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, sometimes also magnetometers.

### Essential Sensors / Sparkfun

https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12862

**Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout **- MMA8452Q - Senses acceleration along all three axes, with a range of up to Â±3g. Fully analog interface.
**Hall Effect Sensor** - Holding a magnet near this sensor will cause the output pin to toggle. This makes for a robust presence sensor.
**Tilt Sensor **- A simple AT407 basic tilt switch that can easily be used to detect orientation on your project.
**Piezo Element** - These two Piezo elements come in handy when you need to detect vibration or a knock. You can use these for tap or knock sensors pretty easily by reading the voltage on the output.
**Insulated Reed Switch** - Senses magnetic fields, makes for a great non-contact switch.
**IR Receiver Diode** - The TSOP382 is a miniaturized receiver for infrared remote control systems.
**Infrared LED** - This is a very simple, clear infrared LED. These devices operate between 940-950nm and work well for generic IR systems.
**TMP36** - Temperature Sensor - The TMP36 is a low voltage, precision centigrade temperature sensor. It provides a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the Celsius temperature.
**Trimpot 10K with Knob** - This 10K trimmable potentiometer has a small knob built right in and itâs breadboard friendly to boot!
**0.25" Magnet Square **- Plays nicely with the reed switch. Embed the magnet into stuffed animals or inside a box to create a hidden actuator to the reed switch.
**0.5" Force Sensitive Resistor **- A force sensing resistor with a 0.5" diameter sensing area. Great for sensing pressure (i.e. if itâs being squeezed).
**Mini Photocell** - The photocell will vary its resistance based on how much light itâs exposed to. Will vary from 1kÎ© in the light to 10kÎ© in the dark.
**Flex Sensor **- As the sensor is flexed, the resistance across the sensor increases. Useful for sensing motion or positioning
**Piezo Buzzer/Speaker** - This is a small 12mm round speaker that operates around the audible 2kHz range. You can use these speakers to create simple music or user interfaces.
Resistor 1.0M Ohm 1/6 Watt PTH - Two 1/6th Watt, +/- 5% tolerance PTH resistors. Commonly used in breadboards and perf boards
