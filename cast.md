# Gou Sokyeo

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1474384734/Gou_Sketch_z1dmps.jpg)

Gou's not your average 13 year old boy. He's rolling infact, but you would never know by the way he acts. He's an elit3, a self-tought hacker that can write code, make PCB boards and likes hacking science. 

His main mentor was Ophir, but Gou quickly found a hack for finding many mentors. 

He's a private kid, and doesn't talk much, unless he's talking to his brother Nōn and sister Lilu, then he just won't shut up sometimes.

But to others, he plays it cool. He keeps what he does a secret for the most part, cuz when other kids find out what he's up too, they get a little too excited. Some even freak the #$@$#@! out.

He picked up on this stuff quick says it was his ability to comprehend what he reads that helps most, and that he has no fear when it comes to actually building stuff. 

Gou is a maker, a hacker and an entrepreneur. Most adults would give an arm and a leg to be in his position. Corporations are constantly trying to hire him. Last year, Google even went crazy trying to find others like him, but there aren't many.

Not because he's a genius or anything, simply because not enough people get "The Hacker Way."

Gou's an interesting kid, with an eclectic bunch of incredible friends ranging from Google Technologist Award winners, to Dr. Winslow and the Rabbi, and even once got to meet Elon Musk. But other than that, he's not famous yet by any means. 

In-fact, his life hasn't always been easy. And to make matters worse, his own neighborhood can sometimes be pretty scary.

He lives in Garfield Park, on the West Side of Chicago. His dad Chino bought an old mansion there at the height of his career, just before the infamous "sabbatical."

When you get to know Gou, you'll quickly learn a few things about him. The first is, don't ask him questions you can easily research yourself. The second, don't be a poser. Don't show off stuff until you're ready. And third, he's only got respect for other kids with mad hustle. 

So if you're just an ordinary kid who has no plans for the future, and you're not even willing to teach yourself cool skills, dudes like Gou probably won't even want to mess with you.

But if he does mess with you, because you're legit, he'll teach you his secret, "The Hacker Way."

It's a combination of trade secrets, certain topics, attitudes and motivation for why be a hacker in the first place.

For Gou, it's not just about having a ton of loot either. It's about tampering with the very edge of innovation, it's about being an engineering guru like Tesla, Zuck, Jobs or Elon Musk. He would rather be any one of those guys before trying to be the next Lionel Messi or Rapper. 

Don't get me wrong, Gou's got mad respect for rappers, actors and athletes. Infact, he's Nōn's biggest fan, but he's not as interested in sports as most kids are. Infact, he doesn't watch any sports besides going to his brothers games on Saturdays and Sundays. 

And this stuff didn't always come easy to Gou. There was a time where he just didn't get it. But that time quickly passed and he became a master. 

Right now, Gou's slated for MIT, but that's if he even decides to go to college. He already has a couple of inventions on the market doing well. 

If you take advantage of Gou's teachings when you read his notes, you might find an opportunity yourself to make your own, real invention, like the dudes from Snapchat or Philip Hartman. 

Philip won the 2008 Young Inventor of the Year award for inventing a new system for fusing optical fibers. His latest invention emits steam onto a windshield and is capable of defrosting a frost-covered windshield in about 15 seconds.

But Gou's not all about the paper chase and has many inventions that could theoretically make money.

The reason Gou does all this is because he simply loves it. He says it's like doing art, solving puzzles and fighting a war. 

Whatever that means.

# Antonio 'Nōn' Sokyeo

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1474384739/Non_Sketch_rprmku.jpg)

Nōn Sokyeo is Gou's younger brother. They are 11 months apart. He's 12. 

Nōn knows quite a bit about Python and Natural Language Processing. But outside of that, he's not much of a hacker quite yet, although he wishes he was. 

Nōn is a top soccer player however. He plays for the American Academy, FC United and plays a couple years up with the 03' boys. 

He's a ladies man. We should mention that, and he's also the class president. Yup, he's a stud. 

Nōn's favorite thing to do is to go to the school dance every other Friday night. That and did we mention, play soccer? He really likes juggling.

He got started with Python when he first turned 10, and he's a bit of a newb still, but he's really good with comprehension and memorizing things. 

He said the hardest part about learning to code was that he wasn't motivated to even learn it in the first place. That all changed the day he figured out that Gou was using it to make mad money though. Real quick.

# Lilu

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1474384732/Lily_Sketch_c4y6st.jpg)


Lilu is the baby sister. She's an AP math student and goes to the high school for math classes. No one knows how, because her father Chino certainly doesn't help with the math. 

Vero, the kids caretaker is decent, but nothing compared it to. Gou thinks it's because she pays attention so well, but her teachers say it's something else. They say she has a really good memory.

She's not into programming yet, and doesn't even realize she's helping Gou solve his hardest problems when she helps him figure out his algorithms and equations in the code he writes. 

Lilu has a thing for puppies, singing and drones. She's been saving up to buy the new Karma drone. 

She rescued a maltipoo from a terrible owner not too long ago, he's great. And funny.

Lilu's in the 3rd grade but teachers have been wondering if she should move up a grade. 

Oh, and she loves tomatoes for some reason. She eats them all the time.

> One of the not-so-obvious side benefits of the miniaturization of electronics is that folks far removed from the realm of electronic engineering become comfortable with small electronic devices and think, “Wouldn’t it be neat if I had a [gizmo] that did…?” Back when computers were called “workstations” their inner workings seemed mysterious, complex, and expensive, and few consumers thought about how they could exploit the computational power. But now that the equivalent of a workstation fits into a hand-sized smartphone complete with a rechargeable power source and a high-definition screen,  software creation is appealing to a non-technical audience. There’s an app for seemingly everything, and even 10-year olds are creating them.
