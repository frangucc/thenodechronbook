# Awareness
> Part 1 is dedicated to the awareness of the hackers surroundings. This includes establishing headquarter boundaries, monitoring the presence of other living beings and the natural security around home. Starting with this gives the reader the opportunity to learn about all the core senses such as sight, sound, vibration, proximity and security.

The following macro and micro axiom cards will be collected in the first part. Items in bold have been 'cardified' and 'allocated'. Items not on bold must still be cardified and allocated.
