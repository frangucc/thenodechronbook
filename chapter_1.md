#  The Raspberry PI 101 - Title TBD

> Introducing the CC sized computer revolution and its amazing applications - insert quote here


## Who's using the Raspberry PI

* Pioneering Applications - smaller, cheaper, empowering new apps
* Educational Applications - expiraments, GPIO, microcontroller, coding for all, accessibility
* Global world problem solving applications - explore the fields this touches - the interesting work being done world wide with these devices - profile



## Intro to PI Hardware - PI 1, 2, 3 and ZERO


> PI 3 Quad Core 1.2 GHZ - half the speed of a new laptop


### SCREENPLAY



---


> Location of Non + Gou and their physical interaction screenplay - tbd

**Non:** Dude, have you seen the new PI 3?

**Gou:** No, but I did just finish creating a PI Zero cluster using Docker. 

**Non:** What? Where did you get that many PI Zeros, my friends waited in line for an entire day and only could get one! How much did you pay? 

> Non stares at Gou waiting for a reaction. Gou then quielty responds.  

**Gou:** Promo-codes dummy, I paid five bucks each and bought 50 of em.










## PI Setup



## PI Performance


> How fast exactly is a PI out of the box


* What can you overclock it to and how to do so (disclaimer)
* Where does it fit in - academically, industrial
* GPIO is digital, no analog is a limitation
* Benchmarking
