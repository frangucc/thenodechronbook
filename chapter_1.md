VOLUME 1
#THE HACKER WAY

> Awareness could actually become the first volume. Biomechanics, biosensing, robotics and Big Data can possibly become the future volumes... 

Theoretically, this chapter gives us a neat little intro to energy, voltage, electricity, basic circuits and some arduino test projects - very basic and simple...

Then, with Turing, we get into the basics of the FSM and modern computing.

From there, Ken and Denniss (neckbeards) take us into Unix and Linux

After, Sir Tim Berners-Lee gives us the invention of the internt and protocols like TCP/IP/HTTP and we can segway into SSH and getting into our PI's and Arduinos remotely with SSH and VNC.... We get our environments fully interet ready and run our first Terminal driven IOT test. Book ends on that note, giving kids the ability to do shit most adults cant...

All future books will be based in the order:

Volume 1 - Awareness (need better name)
