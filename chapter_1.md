VOLUME 1
#THE HACKER WAY


> This is not meant to be read. Skip to the first chapter ([Stealth Mode](https://frangucc.gitbooks.io/gamifyed/content/stealth_mode.html)) if you would like to read this book as if you were ready to begin.

This is an overview of the first volume, meant for contributors. This is an overview of the first volume (the first printed book) and it's contents. 

> The Hacker Way is the  volume. Biomechanics, biosensing, robotics and Big Data are the future volumes... All 5 volumes represent the anatomy of a complete AI system. All 5 volumes will be complete sometime in 2018. The first volume teaches you the foundation, gives you the tools to dig deeper, introduces you to circuitry and programming. With it, *anything is possible*.

Volume 1, the first book, entitled "THE HACKER WAY" has 4 parts.

* Stealth Mode
* Code Crackers
* Neck Beards
* Network Access

**Chapter 1 (Stealth Mode) - **Tesla and the basics of electricity and circuitry with references to John Bardeen and Jack Kilby. Experiments with the Arduino and blinking lights, electricity, voltage, measuring voltage, the very basics come together here while Gou fires up some basic breadboards and circuits. Energy! Theoretically, this chapter gives us a neat little intro to energy, voltage, electricity, basic circuits and some simple Arduino test projects that include resistors, capacitors, voltage, flow, current - very basic and simple circuit patters, gates, logic, fields, electromagnatism. We also disect an Arduino and get into the GPIO.

**Chapter 2 (Code Crackers) -** Turing and the invention of the FSM and modern machines. When we learn about binary, machine code, classifiers and algorithms, compilers, memory, stacks, heaps, etc. We get into the lowest level science of computers possibly and then bring you back out so you don't have to re-invent the wheel, and so you can use higher level language techniques and paradigms to abstract this stuff, but still know what's really going on under the hood. There are many experiments and tests that can teach us about this, and we will start by running them on our laptops in a fool-proof, simple to setup environment. We will also disect a PI and get into the anatomy of how they work, it's processor and run some benchmark, memory and overclocking hacks. 

**Chapter 3 (Neck Beards) - **This chapter starts off with Ken and Dennis, creators of Unix at Bell Labs, inventing Unix on the PDP-11. It ends with Gou and his crew completely owning a Linux environment with all modern tools, which could have never happened without Unix.. ie, Bash, NPM, Node, Git, Terminals, tools, etc. This unlocks the power to do many other things later on, including installing different binaries, getting packages to run, getting Node.js running and we'll end by booting up some cool tools that can automate some hacks.

**Chapter 4 (Network Access) - ** 
After, Sir Tim Berners-Lee gives us the invention of the internet and protocols like TCP/IP/HTTP and we can segue into SSH and getting into our PI's and Arduinos remotely with SSH and VNC.... We get our environments fully internet ready and run our first Terminal driven IOT test. Book ends on that note, giving kids the ability to do shit most adults cant...This chapter gives us a deeper look into the internet, protocols, IP addresses and how data moves across wires, so that later IOT options, storage, ssh and remote controlling devices over different transport protocols can be explored, ranging from WIFI to BLUETOOTH or GSM. By the end, we learn to execute remote tasks on our machines, connect our PI to our Arduino so that we can flash it with scripts and we get our blinking light experiment created by RUSHI setup whereby a little precursor to data is unveiled.. Big data could become the 2nd volume as opposed to the 5th. All future sensor projects require data...
