# Basic Circuitry

## Electricity & what a circuit does
## Circuit elements (Big 3, semiconductor devices)
## Circuit analysis (Kirchhoff, Thevenin/Norton)
## Complex elements (reactive vs. apparent)
## A->D,D->A
## Logic gates (logically complete, NAND->AND/OR)
## Logic elements (Adder, Shift register)
## Computer architecture
## Instruction set
