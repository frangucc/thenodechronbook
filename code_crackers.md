## Screenplay overview, *non-technical*

To introduce modern software, we introduce the state machine or FSM, or turing machine - which is the premise behind memory, the stack/heap and microprocessing. This is the starting point. Many other after came along to improve and modernize software, but this was the major breakthrough in modern computing.

**Segway to the Alan Turing section:**

Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behavior was still ****a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. 

Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning.

Alan Turing invented the turing machine to crack Nazi code generated by their infamous Enigma Machine. By deciphering encrypted messages captured over the air waves, Turing helped the opposition learn the Nazi's plans and positioning for attack. The turing machine would later become the premise of every modern computer. Finite State Machines are what interprets the binary system of all mainstream hardware and operating systems to this very day. He is considered one of the most significant inventors of the 20th century.

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTRO: ** Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing creates the Turing Machine which helps the opposition win the war against the Nazis. It becomes the premise of all modern computing. 

#### Turing PART 1

First part must talk about the turing machine and what he created and how he used it to defeat the Nazis.

#### Turing PART 2

Alan Turing was unjustly prosecuted in 1952 for what most people today do not regard as a criminal act.  Turing accepted an alternative, yet far more barbaric sentence rather than prison

> **PANEL ONE** - ALAN TURING IS BEING ABUSED IN AN INSANE ASYLUM, HE IS WEARING A STRAIGHT JACKED AND BEING TAKEN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE WILL BE CASTRATED (WE DON'T SAY CASTRATED IN THE DIALOGUE, BUT THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPEND TO THE INVENTOR OF THE MODERN DAY COMPUTER). HE IS FIRST SEEN THROUGH THE SMALL FACE PANEL OF THE DOOR FOR THE INSANE ASYLUM HE IS IN.

* **1 CAP:** We are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge.

* **2 WARDENS ASSISTANT:** Let's go Alan, it's your turn.

> **PANEL TWO** - THE WARDENS ASSISTANT RIPS THE MASK OFF HIS FACE.

* **3 ALAN:** No, please, you don't understand.

> **PANEL THREE** - A CLOSE UP OF THE WARDENS FACE AS HE SENTENCES ALAN TO HIS PUNISHMENT.

* **4 WARDEN:** It's quite the shame. Inventor of the modern computer, a queer.

> **PANEL FOUR** - A CLOSE UP ALAN TURINGS SWEET FACE. HE IS A NICE MAN, NEVER HURT ANYONE. HE IS FRIGHTENED AND HAS BEEN TREATED LIKE AN ANIMAL.

* **5 ALAN:** I'm a human being, you can't do this to me!!!

> **PANEL FIVE** - ALAN IS DRAGGED AWAY PAST MULTIPLE INSANE PEOPLE ON THE FLOORS, CHAINED TO WALLS LIKE CAGED ANIMALS. HE IS TAKEN FOR HIS PUNISHMENT.

* **6 ALAN:** Please, don't do this to me. It's not my fault!

* **7 CAP:** We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

**PI SETUP SCRIPT**

1) I must *FLASH* the OS IMAGE if I want to boot the PI.

2) When I *BOOT* the PI with the IMAGE and hold F7 i get a [LINUX TERMINAL]

3) On Linux, I run [these commands] to get Node.js and NPM installed

4) When I install [GIT] using [NPM] i can then run any open source script or app.

5) When I *clone* a repo with GIT I can run it by following the README

6) If I [Install Gou's Remotify App] I can VNC or Terminal or SSH into my PI and get ROOT access and run any command on the machine I want. [add to Remoting In Chapter]
