**PI SETUP SCRIPT**

1) I must *FLASH* the OS IMAGE if I want to boot the PI.

2) When I *BOOT* the PI with the IMAGE and hold F7 i get a [LINUX TERMINAL]

3) On Linux, I run [these commands] to get Node.js and NPM installed

4) When I install [GIT] using [NPM] i can then run any open source script or app.

5) When I *clone* a repo with GIT I can run it by following the README

6) If I [Install Gou's Remotify App] I can VNC or Terminal or SSH into my PI and get ROOT access and run any command on the machine I want. [add to Remoting In Chapter]
