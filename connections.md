CHAPTER #
# NETWORK ACCESS

> Origins of the internet and networks. Brief history then immediate transition to modern day in Gou Sokyeo's life and knowledge of networks. 

Invention of the IP Address, the internet, TCP/IP/ Protocols, SSH, etc. Only the need to knows that stood up. Intro to UNIX and the first OS systems. 


> This is an important step in working with modern technology. Get root acces and control of the machines, their IP's, possibly SSH acess, VNC access, access to the code editors, etc.

Couple things. 

The Raspberry Pi has no screen. All the available screens suck right now anyhow. 

We're going to setup a way for our phones to act as our linux shell and remote into our PI's static IP that we give it. 

This is the first major hacking into the PI event. This will be significant.

Script should feel like this....


**PI SETUP SCRIPT**

1) I must *FLASH* the OS IMAGE if I want to boot the PI.

2) When I *BOOT* the PI with the IMAGE and hold F7 i get a [LINUX TERMINAL]

3) On Linux, I run [these commands] to get Node.js and NPM installed

4) When I install [GIT] using [NPM] i can then run any open source script or app.

5) When I *clone* a repo with GIT I can run it by following the README

6) If I [Install Gou's Remotify App] I can VNC or Terminal or SSH into my PI and get ROOT access and run any command on the machine I want. [add to Remoting In Chapter]
