### possible use in intro

The Node Chronicles is a one-of-a-kind graphic novel that weaves full lifecycle project tutorials with vivid hacker culture and clever depictions of the industry.  

The Node Chronicles starts off with a dive into the PI Zero (and later the Arduino) by having the protagonist examine some critical use cases of tiny computers and microcontrollers. The book illuminates the common traits of an MIT taoist programming prodigy, Gou, and the life around him.

The book has many derrived benefits as well. For example it highlights dozens upon dozens of cutting edge hardware components, sensors and code snippets used in thousands of bleeding edge electrical computer devices. ECE is a field where everything is becoming a computer. The process of designing new electrical devices in every shape, form and texture is well encapsulated and visually communicated by this book. It helps inspire kids to want to learn in this area.

"Our initial barriers in teaching young engineers had everything to do with the demonstrations of "why hackers huge amounts of time dedicated to this" and "what becomes of inventors when they follow and break the rules." The nature of the graphic novel has unshackled us from the traditional text book and in the future we may develop games and an animated series to go along with our products."

The field of ECE is expanding rapidly and includes a combination of EE, CS and Software Engineering. This transmedia form of learning navigates through each of these degrees in an way and that continuously praises the well grounded engineerist who has knowledge of the business around your innovations, common pitfalls and warewithall requirements of becoming successful.

The engineerist reading this book will become familiar with the critical concepts needed experiment with hundreds of scientific sensors, capture their inputs and write their applications. This new and well put together graphic medium gives readers of all ages the context in which the most important open source innovations have risen. Moreover, it covers the socioeconomic scenarios in which their creators battled to launch their ideas.  

The books key takeaway is that it is as much as a cultural indoctrination as it is a tutorial and learning mechanism.

Our research over the past two years has consistently proved that young masters of success latch onto vivid context. Boys obsessed with watching professional athletes on YouTube teach themselves new techniques. Girls inspired by talented singers on Television watch and listen to clips over and over. In general, prodigies are becoming the new norm for American families and so can the idea of raising a young engineer. 

The Node Chronicles attempts to be what Thrasher magazine was to skateboarding in the 80's and 90's - a movement which led to the exponential motivation and advancement of the sport. Todays professional skateboarders are doing unthinkable things because of Thrashers ability to steadily capture the industry at any given moment consistently.

The show Mr. Robot and The Silicon Valley recently highlighted that television could be combined with reasonably accurate technical content to create a show loved by millions while being cultishly coveted by an entire industry. Fans of these shows who code or do start-ups love one thing, that they are somewhat accurate on the technical content. Millions more are even more fascinated who know less about the field and it's because the field is filled with excitement, danger, risk, betrayal and tons of other concerns.

A media scan at any given moment is all you need to find inspiration for content. Millions of people write incredibly amazing tutorials and are now making chips and boards that do the unimaginable and Gamifyed simply curates this stuff and fits it all into a classical context. When read from cover to cover in just under a couple hours you walk away with a sense of accomplishment, a new vocabulary and theoretical base of knowledge that's well worth the $75 dollars. 

While other economies around the world lead in manufacturing and even education, America is typically known for their innovation. We also happen to be the leading contributors to the open source movement by a landslide.

The Node Chronicles is pushing a similar boundary in American education. With more than 250 schools already analyzing this for their classrooms and 2500 books sold, the user feedback we've gotten can be grouped into three important statistics about this book.

* 250 teachers representing close to 250 schools purchased the book unaware that they were part of a survey. Each were shipped the first edition and given a month to analyze the book. After the first month they were given a survey. Of the 250 surveys sent, 226 responded within a week. 

96% of the respondands answered three simple questions .

How likely are you to push to make this required reading for your STEM program?

How likely are you to recommend this to parents interested in their kids learning about electronics, coding and computer engineering?

How likely are you to purchase more products from us in the future? 

Here were the results of the survey. 

In 2017, Gamifyed will continue to invest in it's vision to become the leading cultural curator for classrooms and homes where ECE is quickly becoming a top priority. With 50 billion IoT Devices to come online by the year 2020 and each field becoming an information technology field, the prospect of a new "academy" style cultural movement for kids and teenagers could be huge. 

The Node Chronicles is the first real, American born, globally relevant graphic novel based on the fascinating tech culture, with historical references to pioneers and their personal situations ranging from Tesla and Alan Turing to Bill Gates and Massimo Banzi.
