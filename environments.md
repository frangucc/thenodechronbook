# Remote-In

This is perhaps the most important step in working with modern technology. Get root acces and control of the machines, their IP's, possibly SSH acess, VNC access, access to the code editors, etc.

Couple things. 

The Raspberry Pi has no screen. All the available screens suck right now anyhow. 

We're going to setup a way for our phones to act as our linux shell and remote into our PI's static IP that we give it. 

This is the first major hacking into the PI event. This will be significant.
