### ON RACISM

Racist. I am a racist. I believe that all races should have the right to protect their race against wrongdoing. I do not hate other races, I respect them. What I do hate are people that do shitty things, unfair things, unjust things. I hate governments that lie and cheat for profit. I hate educators that fail to do their job, and parents the same. I hate inequality. I believe that all sides of town deserve equal opportunity.

But if you notice, we are also all doing bad, together. Except for Asians apparently - props Asia! 

When we created this book, we interviewed counselors and said, what's up with this? They said, particularly when race concentrations are high, in certain areas, or with certain patterns in the home, the kids have no motivation. They are not inspired. 

Before we even met these people this came to our attention, I launched our first campaign stating:

"This book will inspire you kids to want to learn about electrical engineering and computer science."

That's all I knew. As a white (Italian, Polish, Native American) man, trying to teach his own kids his skill, this is what I did. My entire company was formed on the idea that I needed to teach my young. Train my sons in Soccer and Tech, and culture my daughter in math and arts. This is what I've spent the past 10 years on, and will continue to do until I am no longer able. 

The dialogue has to change people. It must go from black, white, yellow, green to => win, learn, share, use wisely. Each race has the right to focus on their own success, but not at the expense of hurting another race, as generating negativity will only hold your race back. 

The answer isn't necessarily that we all come together. Each of our races need to do a better job inspiring our kids to be smarter, to live better and to stay away from trouble. All too often, we as parents incite violence, encourage bad behavior and fail to watch after our own young. I wrote this book as a personal contribution towards the part of our society that I know believes in this, and to persuade the others to cut the shit. 

No excuses, there are plenty of tools to help, plenty of example methods for raising your young.  Stop, make the time, lead by example and develop a style for how you teach.
