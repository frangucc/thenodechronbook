ART NEEDED ASAP

1. Good hacker vs bad hacker splash page - Gou is the good hacker. 


   > Hacker is a term for both those who write code and those who exploit it. Even though these two groups of hackers have different goals, both groups use similar problem-solving techniques. Hacking is really just the act of finding a clever and counterintuitive solution to a problem. Since an understanding of programming helps those who exploit, and an understanding of exploitation helps those who program, many hackers do both.  There are interesting hacks found in both the techniques used to write elegant code and the techniques used to exploit programs.

 

2. Search for the words: ART NEED on all the main pages. You will find tons of work to do. I will try and bring as many of them here as I can or find a way to do this part more elegantly.
