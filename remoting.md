# Remote In

Couple things. 

The Raspberry Pi has no screen. All the available screens suck right now anyhow. 

We're going to setup a way for our phones to act as our linux shell and remote into our PI's static IP that we give it. 

This is the first major hacking into the PI event. This will be significant.

PRESENT DAY, PAGES 11-20

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTERNAL INTRO: ** Gou and his brother Nōn are having a mixed conversation in their secret basement headquarters about their father, hacking and some of the cool stuff Gou's been setting up around the house. You get a sense for what sorts of projects Gou's working on and his relationship with his father and siblings.

What's more interesting in this chapter is that there's clearly a struggle and pressure. Gou is hiding what he's doing from his father, who when first depicted in the book appears to be an angry man. Almost as if a reincarnation of Tesla, only meaner and more badass. In the first chapter, Gou is caught with one of his hacking devices and his father snaps and rages, much like JP Morgan Jr. does in the first scene. 

While Tesla and Turing had to deal with much worse situations, it reminds us that even today, there is always conflict, there is always something or someone standing in your way. Gou's current conflict with his father (who somewhat even resembles Tesla) is a prelude to a much more dramatic situation towards the end of the book.

Eventually, Gou's father teams up with Gou after snapping out of his funk. This happens once the antagonist role is passed off to the greedy vulture capitalist duo (Brad and Eric) who try and steal Gou's invention using lawyers, shady dealings and politics. Gou's father has no choice at this point to shave, shape up and get in gear and represent the ultimate father and sons family business, something many fathers would love to have and share with their sons.

PAGE 11 & 12 [PROPERTY & BASEMENT INTRO]


![](https://cl.ly/3H2x0X10460z/NC_06_v2_72.jpg)

* **1 CAP:** Thus 'stealth mode' was their only option; Tesla, Turing and the hundreds of pioneers who came before Gou Sokeyo paid the ultimate sacrafices, their inventions forwarded and eventually, even their lives were lost. Human greed and lust for power will never change; there's always a snake in the grass waiting to strike. 

* **2 CAP:** For the two boys and their sister Lilu, why their father bought the old Frank Lloyd Wright house has and will always be a mystery. Vero their caretaker says it was a bad investment their father Chino made just before he cracked up and quit working. 

* **3 CAP:** Tucked away hidden down in the back of a prohibition era basement exists one of todays greatest young hackers. Frightened more than by any, his father hasn't the slightest clue what he's up to downstairs, for if he had, he would "KILL HIM."

> **PANEL ONE** - THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF REVEALING SHOTS GOING FROM FAR TO NEAR OF GOU AND NON IN THEIR HIGHLY SECRETIVE BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS. BEHIND THE STAIRCASE AND AROUND THE BEND OF THE LARGE BASEMENT ROOM, A WALL FILLED WITH STORED STUFF EMERGES. DOZES OF HUGE BOXES STACKED TO THE CEILING REVEALSE GLIMSES OF LIGHT FROM THE CRACKS WHERE THE EDGES OF EACH BOX MEET, RESEMBLING THE OUTLINE OF A DOOR BEHIND THE BOXES. THE BOYS HAVE MASKED AN ENTIRE WALL WITH A DOOR AS IF THE BASEMENT ENDED RIGHT THERE (THE LIGHT IS ONLY ON BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THERE WORKING). WHEN THE CORRECT BOX IS MOVED, A HOLE LEADS TO A DOOR, WHICH ONCE ENTERED OPENS UP INTO GOU'S SECRET BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS (BHQ). IT'S HOW THEY GET IN AND OUT. ONLY THE TWO BROTHERS AT THIS POINT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE. SEE REFERENCES OF WHAT THIS BASEMENT COULD LOOK LIKE BELOW.

![](https://cl.ly/1J221G2v2z2h/NC_06_72.jpg)

FRANK TODO: Add references to this scene about the green mill, al capones old hideouts, pathways to city hall - this interesting place could be the underground railroad in Chicago.

The general idea of the 10th and 11th page is that it's the opening to the setting. Zoom from afar to see the big home and what the landscape looks like. Zoom into see the ornate brickwork of the old politicians small mansion in Garfield Park. Get into the basement, which rumor has it was once connected to Al Capones underground railroad system and that you could get to city hall and the green mill from the basement tunnels. Just at the foot of the tunnel is the last room which is the only access to the tunnel. This is where Gou and Non have setup shop. The room is blocked off by a bunch of old boxes, Lily, Chino and Vero have no idea it's there. 

> **PANEL TWO** - CLOSER REVEAL OF THE TWO BOYS WORKING OUT OF GOU'S STEALTH MODE HEADQUARTERS...

![](https://cl.ly/2R2b351z2U2C/NC_08_72.jpg)

* **2 CAP:** Tis not without strife Gou secretly develops his innovations in stealth mode, for his father Chino does not want him to follow in his footsteps. [Add much more cleverness to this caption: As in the days of yester the top inventors, for whatever reasons, worked in stealth mode. Stuff about copycats, greedy companies and politicians are always searching for the next big thing and they lack their own creativity to invent them.]

> **PANEL THREE** - EVEN CLOSER... UNTIL WE GET RIGHT UP BEHIND THEM AND SEE WHAT GOU'S WORKSTATION AND SETUP LOOKS LIKE. OFF AND AROUND THE AREA ARE PALETS OF OLD PC'S COVERED IN TARPS AND STACKS OF OLD PC POWER SUPPLIES THAT GOU HAPPENS TO BE SALVAGING FOR SOME REASON. THE COMPUTER SCREENS HAVE GECKOBOARDS AND GOU IS CLEARLY MONITORING EVERYTING FROM LATEST BITCOIN STOCK PRICES TO SECURITY CAMERAS AROUND THE PROPERTY. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IT'S THE START OF A CIA LIKE HEADQUARTER HACKER OPERATION AND THAT THERE IS A TON OF ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

* **3 CAP:** It's no secret that the worlds greatest inventors, from Davinici to Einstein kept their inventions a secret until they were ready. 

* **4 CAP:** By banning Gou from hacking on code and hardware, his father Chino had inadvertently created one of the youngest stealth mode hackers on the planet.

PAGE 13

> **PANEL ONE** - FULL PAGE PANEL. GOU IS FIXATED ON A HIGHLY EXPIRAMENTAL PROJECT WHICH HE DOESN'T QUITE SHARE WITH THE READER YET (SPOILER ALERT, IT'S THE NODE). GOU'S TAKING A HUGE RISK BY DOING THIS IN HIS BASEMENT, AS HE'S BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HACK ON COMPUTERS BY HIS FATHER. NON COULD GET IN TROUBLE JUST FOR BEING AROUND GOU IT'S THAT DANGEROUS. AND WHILE TOTALLY CHILL MOST OF THE TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF CHINO, THEIR FATHER. IN THIS PANEL, WE SEE A CLOSEUP OF GOU'S FACE AND NODE.

* **1 CAP:** Swarn to be a normal boy and not to get caught up in computers and technology, Gou Sokyeo taught himself the art of electrical computer engineering against his fathers wishes. 


PAGE 14 [SHOWING OFF, GOU & NON FIRST DIALOGUE]

> **PANEL ONE** - FIRST EVER SCENE WITH GOU AND NON, THEY ARE INTRODUCED AS A PAIR, ONLY GOU IS CLEARLY THE LEAD HACKER IN THE FAMILY. NON'S JUGGLING A MINI SOCCER BALL (SIZE 1 FUTSAL BALL). AFTER ABOUT 60 JUGGLES HE SMASHES THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SMASHES AN OLD UNUSED MONITOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE IN. NEXT TO HIM IS ARE SEVERAL STACKS OF OLD POWER SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD PCS. THE PCS ARE IN ANOTHER HUGE PILE, COVERED UP BY A TARP, JUST IN CASE.

* **Sound:** Pap, pap, pap, pap

> **PANEL TWO** - A CLOSE UP OF NONS CAREFUL LOOK AS HE JUGGLES THE BALL COMFORTABLY ON HIS FOOT. PROPER FORM IS KEY TO THIS SHOT. 

* **Sound Continues:** Pap, pap, pap, pap, powwwww-boooot!!!

> **PANEL THREE** - NON GOES FROM A JUGGLE TO A VOLLEY KICK, SHOOTING THE BALL INTO A LINE DRIVE ACROSS THE ROOM THEY ARE IN AND NAILS AN OLD COMPUTER SCREEN AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE NONS DESK (WHICH HE NEVER USES).

* **1 Nōn:** 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, g-g-g-g-goooooallllllla-soooooo

> **PANEL FOUR** - NON DOES A CELEBRATION DANCE, THE RONALDO MOVE, AFTER HE SCORES - HE'S EXAGGERATING AND MAKING A BIG DEAL OF THE SILLY GOAL HE SCORES, AND ISN'T PHASED BY DAMAGING THE SCREEN. 

* **2 Gou:** Will you get outta here with that ball! I'm working!

> **PANEL FIVE** - GOU SHOUTS AT NON.

* **3 Nōn:** Hastag Anger Issues. What's dad got against us messing with technology anyhow? And why are you salvaging old PC power sources? 

``````

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ccluhu_XIAAcV29.jpg:large)

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU RESPONDS TO NON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED ANYMORE AS HE WORKS ON A PART OF THE NODE. HE RESPONDS TO NON VERY CASUALLY, AS IF BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT NON HAS TO SAY. NON IS WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY AND IS CLEARLY MORE OF A JOCK, WHILE GOU IS DRESSED IN HIS BASEMENT HACKER OUTFIT (SEE CHAPTER WARDROBE NOTES BELOWS)

* **3 Gou** I dunno. I think he doesn't want us to grow up to fast... that and I think something happened to him in the industry just before he went on his sabbatical. And I'm replacing the coils with Rodin Coils. Testing something...

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON STOPS BOUNCING THE BALL AS IF HE'S INTENTIONALLY LEFT IT ROLL AWAY AS HE FACES GOU. HE LOOKS CONCERNED AND NERVOUS FOR GOU AS HE TRIES TO WARN HIM. BUT GOU DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE AS CONCERNED.

* **4 Nōn** You know if he catches you down here with all this stuff he's gonna kill you.

> **PANEL EIGHT** - GOU HOLDS UP THE HC-SRO4 SONAR SENSOR AND EXPLAINS TO NON THAT HE'S IMPLEMENTED HIS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM. GOU HOLDS UP THE SENSORS BEFORE NONS EYES BUT NONS NOT AMAZED, RATHER, HE'S SKETPICAL, AS IF TO SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

* **5 Gou** I got eyes and ears on him all the time. You see this sonar sensor? If he even comes near the basement door upstairs I'll know. 

* **5.1 NOTE** Get the HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor expansion pack online and setup your own security system like Gou. 

* **5.2 QR CODE** http://store.gamifyed.com/#/sonar-expansion-pack

* **6 CAP** Disguised as a normal thirteen year old boy, Gou is one of most elite ECE hackers in the world. From his secret basement headquarters in Garfield Park, he takes part in the most innovative programming and engineering projects known to man.

* **7 Nōn** The guys a couch potatoe.

> **PANEL TWO** - WE CUT TO A SCENE OF CHINO UPSTAIRS LAYING ON THE COUCH IN HIS ROBE. IT'S THE AFTERNOON AND HE CLEARLY HAS NO AMBITION. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THIS PANEL TBD.

* **1 Gou** You know Vero said he wasn't always a bum, and that one day he completely changed, almost as if he gave up on life.

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4YL3UsAQ4i-d.jpg)

> **PANEL THREE** - THE IMAGE OF CHINO IS INTERRUPTED BY A RANDOM UH OH MOMENT NON HAS WHEN HE REALIZES HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER LILU. HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER BUT NOT TO WORRY THIS TIME, THE BOYS QUICKLY FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING.

* **2 Nōn** Where's Lilu? 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cdh4GDSUMAApZAt.jpg)

> **PANEL FOUR** - WHILE FOCUSED IN ON THE COIL HE'S FINALLY RIPPED OUT OF THE LAST POWER SUPPLY, GOU CASUALLY MURMERS TO NON THAT LILU IS OUTSIDE FLYING A DRONE HE MADE HER. 

![](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/image/file/111261/IMG_20160113_180144.jpg?w=580&h=435&fit=max&fm=jpg)

* **3 Gou** She's out flying the drone I built her. Check it out, I can see whatever the drone sees. 

* **4 CAP** TBD

> **PANEL FIVE** - NONS FACE IS PRICELESS. AT FIRST IT SORTA GOES OVER HIS HEAD, BUT THEN, POW IT HITS HIM.

* **5 Nōn** A drone? But who, but when?

* **6 Nōn** A drone!!!! You made a drone! That's fricking crazy! 

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU PULLS UP THE VIDEO OF LILU'S DRONES CAMERAS POINT OF VIEW AS IT HOVERS OVER THE EDGE OF THE GARFIELD PARK CONSERVATORY WHICH IS PRACTICALLY CONNECTED TO THEIR BACK YARD. THEY TUNE IN AND WATCH THE VIDEO STREAMING FROM THE DRONE ON ONE OF GOU'S MANY COMPUTER SCREENS. NON HOVERS OVER HIS SHOULDER TO TAKE A PEEK AND IS IMPRESSED, BUT NOT ASTONISHED. NON'S USED TO HIS BROTHER DOING STUFF LIKE THIS. GOU SOMETIMES MAKES NON NERVOUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY'LL GET INTO IF THEIR FATHER FINDS OUT THEIR MESSING WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

* **7 Gou** Yeah, check it out, looks like she's flying it over the conservatory out back.
![](http://www.modmypi.com/image/cache/data/rpi-products/raspberry-pi-zero/DSC_0155-800x609.jpg)

* **8 Nōn** That's so cool. You made that with the PI Zero?

![](https://cl.ly/191G3X280W1H/NC_12_72.jpg)

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON AWAITS GOUS ANSWER AS GOU FINISHES HIS GLANCE AT THE COMPUTER SCREENS. HE IS SIMULTANIOUSLY HACKING ON HIS PROJECT WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CONVERSATION WITH NON AND WHILE PULLING UP THE DRONES POV CAMERA OVERLOOKING THE ARIAL SHOT OF THE CONSERVATORY.

* **8 Gou** Yep. Two actually, one in the drone and one in the XBOX remote I hacked.

![](https://cl.ly/3c0Q2o1H3V0f/NC_09_72.jpg)

* **8 Gou** Using a Particle Electron, they sent me one to test, it's still in Beta. It's got a Ublox chip that gives me 3G access anywhere a cell phone works. It's nice but the resolution has to be highly compressed for it to stream in real-time.

* **9 QR CODE** Get the drone expansion pack at http://shop.gamifyed.com/#/drones

## Who's using the Raspberry PI

* Pioneering Applications - smaller, cheaper, empowering new apps
* Educational Applications - experiments, GPIO, microcontroller, coding for all, accessibility
* Global world problem solving applications - explore the fields this touches - the interesting work being done world wide with these devices - profile

---
** CHAPTER 1: ** Page 1: TBD

> **PANEL ONE** - TBD

* **Non:** Dude, have you seen the new PI 3?



This is one of my favorite things to talk about. What are they used for today but more importantly, what are they going to be used for more in the near future? What's so great about them?

1. They are much cheaper than a computer and you get a real computer
2. They are unique in their own right because they have a GPIO - laptops and PC's do not offer a GPIO. 
3. CC sized computers with greater processing power, ones like we may see in the very near future enable other equipment used in agriculture, at industry
4. Learning how to minaturize our computers - we're moving backwards to nano and MEMS - which is opening up a whole reange of new applications.

RUSHI: FRANK: TODO: [What are examples of either these chips or IoT suited chips - we are unlocking all this potential]

## Intro to PI Hardware - PI 1, 2, 3 and ZERO
> PI 3 Quad Core 1.2 GHZ - half the speed of a new laptop

What are the constants
1. Same style of GPIO programming
2. Still limited by INPUTs and OUTPUTs
3. Video is still limited, can't be in different formats
4. Still need external peripherals
5. All really good learning devices
6. Low memory, low power
7. C compilers
8. Assembly
9. Bluetooth or Wifi or some connection
10. Microprocessor 
11. Architecture (how many registers they are, what IO ports there are, how are they arranged, how is memory accessed, how much memory is internal to the microprocessor, operating voltage) (ARM) and Programming

What are the variables?

## Operating Systems

An operating system is just a very complicated program. It has the job of organizing other programs on a computer, including sharing the computer's time, memory, hardware and other resources. Some big families of desktop operating systems that you may have heard of include GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. Other devices also need operating systems such as phones, which may use operating systems such as Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

Since the operating system has to interact with the hardware on a computer system, it also has to have specific knowledge of the hardware on a system. To allow operating systems to be used on a variety of computers, the concept of drivers was invented. Drivers are small bits of code that can be added and removed from the operating system in order to allow the operating system to talk to a particular piece of hardware. In this course, we do not cover how to create such removable drivers, and instead focus on making specific ones for the Raspberry Pi.

There are all kinds of different designs of operating systems, and this course can only just scratch the surface. In this course we will mainly focus on getting the operating system to interact with a variety of bits of hardware, as this is often the trickiest bit, and the part for which the least documentation and help exists online.
