Chapter #
# ENVIRONMENTS

> This section must introduce the computer and it's environments. Booting up a board for the first time is essential and understanding the Linux/Unix and getting around, installing some packages and getting up and running to do some damage is key here. The creators of Linux/Unix/ terminals and bash could be explored. 

Unix - It was developed back in 1969 by AT&T employees working at Bell Labs. Linux came about in either 1983 or 1984 or 1991, depending upon who's holding the knife. The GNU operating system was announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman and started in 1984, while the Linux kernel came about in 1991 courtesy of Linus Torvalds.Mar 24, 2008

The history of Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were jointly developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe. Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems.

Ken Thompson, a programmer in the Labs' computing research department, had worked on Multics. He decided to write his own operating system.

While he still had access to the Multics environment, he wrote simulations for the new file and paging system[clarification needed] on it. He also programmed a game called Space Travel, but it needed a more efficient and less expensive machine to run on, and eventually he found a little-used PDP-7 at Bell Labs.[4][5] On the PDP-7, in 1969, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, including Rudd Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes and device files, a command-line interpreter, and some small utility programs.[3] The resulting system, much smaller than the envisioned Multics system, was to become Unix. In about a month's time, Thompson had implemented a self-hosting operating system with an assembler, editor and shell, using a GECOS machine for bootstrapping.[6]

Note that all this led to the MAC OS
Note that Windows called theirs DOS

**NOTES!**
SCREENPLAY TO ADD HERE -- need to flesh out this section asap.

GOU doing some serious hacking in unix, the unix cheat sheet -- getting the environments up and running and prepared to really do some hacking projects... SETUP... Need aretwork, bring in the stuff I got... padd around the stuff I got...
