MOVED THIS, FIGURING OUT...


> **PANEL THREE** - THE IMAGE OF CHINO IS INTERRUPTED BY A RANDOM UH OH MOMENT NON HAS WHEN HE REALIZES HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER LILU. HE APPARENTLY FORGOT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AFTER HIS YOUNGER SISTER BUT NOT TO WORRY THIS TIME, THE BOYS QUICKLY FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE'S DOING.

* **2 Nōn** Where's Lilu?

> **PANEL FOUR** - WHILE FOCUSED IN ON THE COIL HE'S FINALLY RIPPED OUT OF THE LAST POWER SUPPLY, GOU CASUALLY MURMERS TO NON THAT LILU IS OUTSIDE FLYING A DRONE HE MADE HER.

* **3 Gou** She's out flying the drone I built her. Check it out, I can see whatever the drone sees. 

* **4 CAP** TBD

> **PANEL FIVE** - NONS FACE IS PRICELESS. AT FIRST IT SORTA GOES OVER HIS HEAD, BUT THEN, POW IT HITS HIM.

* **5 Nōn** A drone? But who, but when?

* **6 Nōn** A drone!!!! You made a drone! That's fricking crazy! 

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU PULLS UP THE VIDEO OF LILU'S DRONES CAMERAS POINT OF VIEW AS IT HOVERS OVER THE EDGE OF THE GARFIELD PARK CONSERVATORY WHICH IS PRACTICALLY CONNECTED TO THEIR BACK YARD. THEY TUNE IN AND WATCH THE VIDEO STREAMING FROM THE DRONE ON ONE OF GOU'S MANY COMPUTER SCREENS. NON HOVERS OVER HIS SHOULDER TO TAKE A PEEK AND IS IMPRESSED, BUT NOT ASTONISHED. NON'S USED TO HIS BROTHER DOING STUFF LIKE THIS. GOU SOMETIMES MAKES NON NERVOUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH TROUBLE THEY'LL GET INTO IF THEIR FATHER FINDS OUT THEIR MESSING WITH ALL THIS STUFF.

* **7 Gou** Yeah, check it out, looks like she's flying it over the conservatory out back.

* **8 Nōn** That's so cool. You made that with the PI Zero?

![](https://cl.ly/191G3X280W1H/NC_12_72.jpg)

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON AWAITS GOUS ANSWER AS GOU FINISHES HIS GLANCE AT THE COMPUTER SCREENS. HE IS SIMULTANIOUSLY HACKING ON HIS PROJECT WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CONVERSATION WITH NON AND WHILE PULLING UP THE DRONES POV CAMERA OVERLOOKING THE ARIAL SHOT OF THE CONSERVATORY.

* **8 Gou** Yep. Two actually, one in the drone and one in the XBOX remote I hacked.

* **7 Nōn** How are you transmitting the footage? 

> **PANEL SEVEN** - GOU HOLDS UP A PARTICLE ELECTRON BOARD

![](https://cl.ly/3c0Q2o1H3V0f/NC_09_72.jpg)

* **8 Gou** Using a Particle Electron, they sent me one to test, it's still in Beta. It's got a Ublox chip that gives me 3G access anywhere a cell phone works. It's nice but the resolution has to be highly compressed for it to stream in real-time.

* **9 QR CODE** Get the drone expansion pack at http://shop.gamifyed.com/#/drones 

* **10 Nōn** Dope. You should use that for the near space weather balloon project. 

> **PANEL EIGHT** - A CLOSE UP OF GOU'S FACE AS IF HE'S LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE AND IT'S AMAZING.

* **11 Gou** Pier 19 baby. Disrupt. Still need to figure out how to insulate everything. It get's pretty cold up there. 

> **PANEL NINE** - TBD

* **11 Nōn** You're crazy. You're gonna get in serious trouble. 

* **12 CAP** TBD

> **PANEL ONE** - AN ALERT IS TRIGGERD ON GOU'S CELL PHONE. IT GOES OFF WHILE ON HIS WORKSTATION, NEXT TO HIS LAPTOP. A BIRDSEYE VIEW OF HIS DESK IS SHOWN, WITH ALL HIS ELECTRONICS SCATTERED EVERYWHERE AND AN OCULUS RIFT OFF TO THE SIDE. A VIRTUAL REALITY HEADSET WE SEE GOU USE LATER IN THE BOOK.

* **SOUND** Blip. Blip Bleep. 

* **1 Gou** Crap someones coming. Jinx, open terminal. Jinx, turn on camera eight.

> **PANEL TWO** - CAMERA EIGHT IS TURNED ON IN A WINDOW ON HIS FAR RIGHT UPPER MONITOR. GOU HAS 6 MONITORS, 3 ONTOP OF 3. VERO IS WALKING DOWN THE LAST HALL BEFORE THE BASEMENT WITH A LAUNDRY BASKET.

* **2 Gou** Ugh it's Vero. Nevermind. Go distract her and lead her upstairs, tell her I'm at the conservatory doing homework with some friends.

* **3 CAP** Vero, Chino's former front-end engineer is now the kids caretaker. For whatever reasons, she took an oath just before Chino hit rock bottom, never to let his kids suffer.

* **4 Nōn** On it. 

> **PANEL THREE** - NON JETS BACK UP STAIRS TO GREET VERO WHO'S ABOUT TO COME DOWNSTAIRS TO DO LAUNDRY. MAY NEED 2 PANELS HERE.

* **5 Nōn** And you owe me. We're playing soccer later. For two hours straight.

* **6 CAP** Too good of a person, Vero deals with headache after headache helping to raise kids that aren't even hers.

Script should feel like this....


**PI SETUP SCRIPT**

1) I must *FLASH* the OS IMAGE if I want to boot the PI.

2) When I *BOOT* the PI with the IMAGE and hold F7 i get a [LINUX TERMINAL]

3) On Linux, I run [these commands] to get Node.js and NPM installed

4) When I install [GIT] using [NPM] i can then run any open source script or app.

5) When I *clone* a repo with GIT I can run it by following the README

6) If I [Install Gou's Remotify App] I can VNC or Terminal or SSH into my PI and get ROOT access and run any command on the machine I want. [add to Remoting In Chapter]
