# SECTION 1

> In section one, we meet Gou Sokyeo and Nōn for the first time. The two boys discuss various topics in the first part, before transitioning to a bit of history in the second part. By the third part, they are back at present and they leave the reader with some final inspiration for moving forward.

# ACT 2
> They are chatting about what it's truly going to take to become an EECS major, and they get into the topic of Hacking, and what it really means. 


### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 2 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:2:1 OVERVIEW: ** Gou Sokyeo and his brother Nōn are hanging out at the Basement Headquarters per usual. Only today, they're having a Frank discussion about whether Nōn's smart enough to be a hacker.  

> **PANEL ONE** - A HEADSHOT OF NŌN LOOKING CONCERNED.  

* **1 NŌN:** What's all this mean tho Gou, not everyone's a genius like you. And what's a Rosetta Stone dammit?

> **PANEL TWO** - A HEADSHOT OF GOU DEEPLY IMMERSED WITH THE STONE, WHICH HAS YET TO BE FULLY REVEALED. GOU APPEARS TO BE PUTTING WITNESSING IT'S POWER, EVEN FOR HIMSELF, FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. 

* **2 GOU:** Bruh. You're not listening. I can give you all the knowledge you need to become an elit3. Being a genius has nothing to do with it. 

* **3 GOU:** ...woah...

> **PANEL THREE** - 3 QUARTER VIEW OF NŌN RESPONDING TO GOU'S COMMENT. 

* **4 NŌN:** Yeah, but I'm not a math genius. I can't just learn this stuff like you, I'm not as smart as you. 

* **5 NŌN:** But I really want to know this stuff like you!

> **PANEL FOUR** - xxx

* **6 GOU:** How you going to learn applied mathematics or coding if you can't COMPREHEND what I'm telling you? And I'm not that book smart either, I'm just a *hustler. Ummm.. my my teacher say's I'm really great at "comprehension! Does that help?"

Bruh. They have the life. 

I'm in dude. I'm going to commit to this and see if I can hack it. 

Bruh, you don't want to just hack it, you need to own it. :p

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 2 / PAGE 3

** 1:1:2:3 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Tell me more about this stone.

The stone was a hack written on a stone. It was **writen in Egyptian, Greek and Hyroglphs** at once so that anyone in the future could read what the **pharoah** had to say, but it also helped archeologists understand those ancient languages. The stone acts as a legend of sorts.

**So how's that relate? **

There's a **very specific set** of things **you need to know about EECS**, there's **even symbols** that represent the important **fundamentals you need to know**.

![](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/00/6a/c1/006ac13bed80faac37ace6630c6d311a.jpg)

In addition to these **key schematic symbols**, I'm giving you all the rest of the must know things. Here, I put them on some cards for you called **Axiom Cards**. 

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475871937/electro_magnetism_axiom_card_pyjnr5.png)

Owning these cards is the key to becoming a hacker. Once you collect them all and understand them you can make some serious money.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 2 / PAGE 4

** 1:1:2:4 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Yeah, I even made an app so you can keep tabs on this stuff. It keeps track of what you know and gives you props and stuff when you POWN shit.

Money????

Yeah dude, Citrus Byte pays me $75 an hour to hack on iOS and Android apps.

Is that where you get all that money? 

Yeah, from that and, my EGHHHEM, COUGH, bitminers.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 2 / PAGE 5

** 1:1:2:5 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**I'm gonna give you a similar stone right now, that will act as a legend for deciphering this stuff, it even has some "glyphs" of it's own.** It will help you always follow and **understand this stuff**, or **guide you**. If you follow the stone, you will **become an EECS major. **

It's the hackers guide to EECS man. 

EECS? 

**Archimedes** would **be turning in his grave right now...**

Electrical Engineering and Computer Science

**Whaaa?**

**Yeah, it's the dopest industry to be in. **

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878072/everywhere_nxytrz.jpg)

Yeah, but you've been doing this stuff for a hot minute Gou. And isn't hacking bad? [redundant]

Bro, **Tesla was a hacker**. Like, the maker of the cars? **Bruh,** will you shut up** for a second** and **listen**.

# ACT 3

> In Act 3, Gou really explains and introduces some legacy hackers, such as Tesla and Turing. He explains what makes hackers so special. He leaves the act by letting the reader know that there's a stone that will help decipher the industry.


### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:3:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Nikola Tesla was hacking electricity** and Thomas Edisons **Direct Current** empire when he discovered one of the most important aspects of modern electricity. **Alternating Current. **

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 2

** 1:1:3:2 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs]

**Hackers.** (huh...)

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 3

** 1:1:3:3 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Yeah, dude, **Alan Turing,** the dude who invented the **modern concept of a computer,** was literally **CRACKING the German Enigma** when he came up with the** Turing Machine.** His hack saved millions of lives in WWII. The turing machine is the premis for how all modern processors and memory inside your computers work, and how computer think. It's how all that stuff you **play with on your phone get's processed by the chips and stuff!**

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker. 

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gamifyed/NC_08_72.jpg)

**Bruh,** first you need to understand that to **comprehend this stuff**, you need to **take notes** on what I'm telling you and you need to **fit the pieces together **yourself. I'm only going to **give you clues** on what must know things you need to study.** I'll point you in the rigt direction**, always, but if you have what it takes to a hacker, you'll **figure this crap out yourself**. There's no need to pay attention to other stuff. I've got your **Rosetta Stone **for learning this shit. 

**Hahah. Gou's Stone. **


> The first glimpse of the stone, that was once glowing from the window outside Gou's home. We see it a bit closer finally, but not fully. The act ends with an inspiring quote from the Tao.

[We need a literally "text" version of Gou's stone we can give away] 

[And we need a dope glowing stone that can represent the legend for all 5 volumes and mastery of EECS. It should look like a combiation of the rosetta stone and some cool glowing stone.]

> Inspiring TAO QUOTE to go with the stone. 

# ACT 4
> Gou gives a high level explanation of the important stuff you're going to need to know and learn. 

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:4:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Here's **how it all basically works. 


### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 2

** 1:1:4:2 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878073/molecule_csquem.jpg)

**So** I need to be a math geek?

**No, **but you ****need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates** to build stuff. 

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878071/boom_rye5oi.jpg)

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 3

** 1:1:4:3 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**But** if you wanna get into MIT, and you don't understand the basics of **Electromagnetism**, **current**, **frequency**, **key algorithms, etc.** you're not gonna get very far. 

**Like** the Big-O notation? 

**Will you stop!** That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. But, well, yes, like the Big-O, but not in that example. Ughh,,.. Nevermind. 

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 4

** 1:1:4:4 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

**Yup.**

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 5

** 1:1:4:5 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are. 

**Like the matrix?**

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies. 

Ok.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 6

** 1:1:4:6 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips => Operating Systems like Linux => Coding and Scripts => Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field. 

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.


# ACT 5

> Act 5 get's on the topic of money and lifestyle of hackers and inventors. 

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 5 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:5:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx


Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**? 

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**. 

**Dab. **

[Scene ends with both brothers dabbing perfectly, hard as hell.]

BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN JR, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **7 JP MORGAN:** I got you're letter. Did you think you could undermine my family? 

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. 

* **10 CAP:** The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.
