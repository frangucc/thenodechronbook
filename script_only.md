# SECTION 1

> In section one, we meet Gou Sokyeo and Nōn for the first time. The two boys discuss what it takes to be a hacker before transitioning to a bit of history in the second part. By the third part, they are back at present and they leave the reader with some final inspiration for moving forward.

---

# PART 1

> In part one, we get to see Gou's hometown, home and the basement headquarters. We get a sense for his environment, family life and normal state. The first part is mostly to get to know how Gou and Non think, talk, behave and what they're generally up to.

---

# ACT 1

> In the very first opening act of the entire saga, we do an arial tour of Gou's town and home, and get into the basement headquarters, also known as, Gou's office.

And so it begins....

# ACT 3

> In Act 3, Gou really explains and introduces some legacy hackers, such as Tesla and Turing. He explains what makes hackers so special. He leaves the act by letting the reader know that there's a stone that will help decipher the industry.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:3:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Nikola Tesla was hacking electricity** and Thomas Edisons **Direct Current** empire when he discovered one of the most important aspects of modern electricity. **Alternating Current. **

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 2

** 1:1:3:2 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Hackers are just people that don't want to accept bullshart as the norm, so they mess around and try to beat tech. They **are always trying to figure out the next move by learning from what's out there**. As a result, they help figure out what to **build next**. Or how to fix things so they can better benefit the **overall industry. **

\[illustrate hackers at industry, awesome jobs, working on cool shit, hackathons, Illustrate the GAME! search these things, hackerspaces, hackathons, hacking, clean rooms, computer science labs, mit labs\]

**Hackers.** \(huh...\)

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 3 / PAGE 3

** 1:1:3:3 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Yeah, dude, **Alan Turing,** the dude who invented the **modern concept of a computer,** was literally **CRACKING the German Enigma** when he came up with the** Turing Machine.** His hack saved millions of lives in WWII. The turing machine is the premis for how all modern processors and memory inside your computers work, and how computer think. It's how all that stuff you **play with on your phone get's processed by the chips and stuff!**

**Ok, so go on.** **Tell me more.** I want to be a hacker.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/gamifyed/NC_08_72.jpg)

**Bruh,** first you need to understand that to **comprehend this stuff**, you need to **take notes** on what I'm telling you and you need to **fit the pieces together **yourself. I'm only going to **give you clues** on what must know things you need to study.** I'll point you in the rigt direction**, always, but if you have what it takes to a hacker, you'll **figure this crap out yourself**. There's no need to pay attention to other stuff. I've got your **Rosetta Stone **for learning this shit.

**Hahah. Gou's Stone. **

> The first glimpse of the stone, that was once glowing from the window outside Gou's home. We see it a bit closer finally, but not fully. The act ends with an inspiring quote from the Tao.

\[We need a literally "text" version of Gou's stone we can give away\]

\[And we need a dope glowing stone that can represent the legend for all 5 volumes and mastery of EECS. It should look like a combiation of the rosetta stone and some cool glowing stone.\]

# ACT 4

> Gou gives a high level explanation of the important stuff you're going to need to know and learn.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:4:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Here's **how it all basically works.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 2

** 1:1:4:2 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**If you understand electrcity,** **fields, forces and flows**, it becomes easier to **visualize** how the lowest level of the **science and tech works** - when it's **beyond the naked eye** and you're dealing with **binary and math.**

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878073/molecule_csquem.jpg)

**So** I need to be a math geek?

**No, **but you **\*\*need to respect it and **make room for it.** A lot of math is done for you and not everyone has to understand **machine code** and **nyquist rates\*\* to build stuff.

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1475878071/boom_rye5oi.jpg)

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 3

** 1:1:4:3 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**But** if you wanna get into MIT, and you don't understand the basics of **Electromagnetism**, **current**, **frequency**, **key algorithms, etc.** you're not gonna get very far.

**Like** the Big-O notation?

**Will you stop!** That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. But, well, yes, like the Big-O, but not in that example. Ughh,,.. Nevermind.

Non: So all these **chips and machines** that make up our **hardware, these microprocessors, memory, motors, etc.** all basically take **voltage from power** sources and **translate them into information **or **motors** somehow?

**Yeah, sorta. **

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 4

** 1:1:4:4 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**Check it.** Basically, you need to know about** electricity and chips,** how they work, and then you need to know how to** put an OS on them **so you can **control them or write pograms to control them**. When you **write the programs**, that's when you'll study **object oriented or functional software. **

**That's when **you write the codes...

**Yup.**

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 5

** 1:1:4:5 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**And** once you know about that stuff, you can learn to **put all your stuff online **and **control stuff** from anywhere you are.

**Like the matrix?**

**Bruh. **Will you stop with the analogies, let me make the analogies.

Ok.

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 4 / PAGE 6

** 1:1:4:6 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

**So let me recap.**

**Electricity & Chips =&gt; Operating Systems like Linux =&gt; Coding and Scripts =&gt; Networking and the Internet?**

**Yes. **Study the stuff in **that order**. And **don't go off the path** - learn what I give you and nothing else right now. There's no time for wastin - it's getting late, you're **already in high school and you're still a newb**. If you don't **grasp** this stuff now, you'll have a** 2% chance** of winning at all in this field.

**Bruh, **please. I'm non-che-b, Gou-nin-yho.

Please don't call me that.

# ACT 5

### SECTION 1 / PART 1 / ACT 5 / PAGE 1

** 1:1:5:1 OVERVIEW: ** xxx

Gou: **Do** you even know what software **engineers** make? Or hardware **hackers**?

Non: **No, **but I know I'd rather be a **Zuck or an Elon Musk** any day of the week before a **Kanye or Kardash.**

Gou: **Kan-yeezy** bruh. Don't dis Kankye. He's so **baller**.

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.

** 1:3:1:1 OVERVIEW: ** The book started off with pitch on why learning EECS is so cool. The second part travelled back into the past to look at the origins of electricity and Teslas interest in phenomena. Part 3, this part, picks up with Non, the NEWB, yearning to start practicing phenomena. But first, he must SSH into his raspberry PI from his computer, so he may get started.

> **PANEL ONE** - Non sits down to try and play with the PI for the first time. He's been reading up on Phenomena and wants to try some stuff. Face at desk, realizes he has to plug the PI into an HDMI monitor, but doesn't want to do that. He'd rather hack into it from his Macbook pro.

* **SOUND:** DANGGG!

* **NON:** I don’t have an HDMI monitor on me, can’t hack. Doesn't this thing have a USB?

> **PANEL TWO - **Non is pissed, he doesn't have a monitor. He's scratching his head. All he wants to do is hack!

* **GOU: **What you try’na do?

* **NON: **Was feeling like practicing some phenomena.

> **PANEL THREE - **Gou has his head tucked in his shirt as if headless and says, with arms out like a bird without a head.

* **GOU: **Go headless bruh. 

> **PANEL FOUR & FIVE - **Huge AHA moment for Non. The gets right back to his laptop and desk and pi while uttering several unwarranted no-doubts.

* **NON: **Oh yeeaahhhhhh…. no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.

### SECTION 1 / PART 3 / ACT 1 / PAGE 2

1:3:1:2 OVERVIEW: After realizing he can get into the PI from his computer, Non must actually do this.

> **PANEL ONE **- Gou asks Non if he knows the IP address so he can SSH in there.

* **GOU:** Do know the PI’s IP? Hack in there. \(to find this, type hostname -I from your Pi's terminal.\)

> **PANEL TWO -** Non responds to Gou. About to be frustrated, he calms his stuff.

* **NON:** I suck at SSH. And no, I don’t have the IP. 
* **NON: **If my PI was hooked up to a monitor I could just type hostname -I from the terminal.

> PANEL THREE - Terrifying anime style shot of Non raging as he screams the following line.

* **NON: **All I want is a SHELL gosh darnit!

* **GOU: **If you got no monitor, your gonna need to plug the PI in and check the Router Device List from another computer on the same WIFI. If you know the router login, it will be easy. If not, you’re gonna need to use NMAP.

* **NON: **NMAP yo.
* **NON: **Get NMAP yo.
* **NON: **No doubt yo.

> PANEL 4 BIG - Non is looking at instructions on the web on how to use NMAP. He's practicing RTFM. He looks up how to use NMAP on google on his laptop, else he would have asked Gou's AI called Node.

* **ON LAPTOP SCREEN: **To use nmap to scan the devices on your network, you need to know the subnet you are connected to. First find your own IP address, in other words the one of the computer you're using to find your Pi's IP address:

* * On Linux, type hostname -I into a terminal window
* * On Mac OS, go to System Preferences then Network and select your active network connection to view the IP address
* * On Windows, go to the Control Panel, then under Network and Sharing Center, click View network connections, select your active network connection and click View status of this connection to view the IP address

> Panel 5 - Non is looking close up at his screen, waiting for NMAP to do it's thang....

* **SCREEN CLOSEUP: ** You NOW have the IP address of your computer! XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

* **NON: **BOOOOM SON!!!!!!!!

### SECTION 1 / PART 3 / ACT 1 / PAGE 3

1:3:1:3 OVERVIEW: After realizing he can

* **GOU: **Yup, now scan the whole subnet for other devices. For example, if your IP address is 192.168.1.5, other devices will be at addresses like 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.4, etc. The notation of this subnet range is 192.168.1.0/24 \(this covers 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255\).

* **Gou: **Or just use the nmap command with the -sn flag \(ping scan\) on the whole subnet range. This may take a few seconds: nmap-sn192.168.1.0/24

* * Ping scan just pings all the IP addresses to see if they respond. For each device that responds to the ping, the output shows the hostname and IP address like so:

> Starting Nmap 6.40 \( [http://nmap.org](http://nmap.org) \) at 2014-03-10 12:46 GMT  
> Nmap scan report for hpprinter \(192.168.1.2\)  
> Host is up \(0.00044s latency\).  
> Nmap scan report for Gordons-MBP \(192.168.1.4\)  
> Host is up \(0.0010s latency\).  
> Nmap scan report for ubuntu \(192.168.1.5\)  
> Host is up \(0.0010s latency\).  
> Nmap scan report for raspberrypi \(192.168.1.8\)  
> Host is up \(0.0030s latency\).  
> Nmap done: 256 IP addresses \(4 hosts up\) scanned in 2.41 seconds  
> Here you can see a device with hostname raspberrypi has IP address 192.168.1.8.

* **NON: **WOOOHHOOOOOO!!!!!

> A HUGE, OVERLY DRAMATIC CELEBRATION HAPPENS that spills out onto the next page.

### SECTION 1 / PART 3 / ACT 1 / PAGE 4

1:3:1:4 OVERVIEW: Continuation of ridiculous celebration from the previous page, all for getting the IP address of the PI to be able to hack into it. This truly is a huge accomplishment to those who are even scared to turn a raspberry Pi on.

> **PANEL ONE - **Non is ready to go. Fired up. He's anxious and is looking down at this beautiful chip called a PI. He then frantically belts out his lines, again, as if about to rage. He's excited.

* **NON: **Ok so now what? I wanna write some scripts and bust out my sensors.

* **GOU: **YO YOU NEED RELAXXXXXXXXX BOY!!!!!!

> **PANEL TWO - **Gou gives new instructions to Non. While standing over Non's shoulder, he tells him what to do next. Non is driving. He's stepped away from his desk to have this moment with Non. It's always exciting to see a newb SSH for the first time, especially when they realize they just hacked into another computer score.

* **GOU: **SSH into that IP you just figured out. If you’re still stuck, try this. DUNCE\_QR\_CANT\_GET\_MY\_PI\_IP\_WAHHH.

* **NON: **You’re such a newb.

* **GOU: **Are you in yet???……………………

\(IF NOT\) QR\_CONNECT\_TO\_PI\_FROM\_DIFF\_COMP\_OVER\_SSH

* **TERMINAL: **ssh pi@&lt;IP&gt;

* **READER NOTE: **If you receive a connection timed out error it is likely that you've entered the wrong IP address for the Raspberry Pi.

* * When the connection works you'll see a security/authenticity warning. Type yesto continue. You'll only see this warning the first time you connect.
  * In the event your Pi has taken the IP address of a device to which your computer has connected before \(even if this was on another network\), you may be given a warning and asked to clear the record from your list of known devices. Following this instruction and trying the ssh command again should be successful.
  * Next you'll be prompted for the password for the pi login: on Raspbian the default password is raspberry. You should now be able to see the Raspberry Pi prompt which will be identical to the one found on the Raspberry Pi itself.

* * > If you have set up another user on the Pi, you can connect to it the same way, replacing the username with your own, e.g. eben@192.168.1.5
    > pi@raspberrypi ~ $
    > You are now connected to the Pi remotely and can execute commands.
    > BONUS ROUND
    > QR\_X-FORWARDING
    > You can also forward your X session over SSH to allow use of graphical applications by using the -Y flag:
    > ssh-Y pi@192.168.1.5
    > Now you're on the command line as before, but you have the ability to open up graphical windows, for example:
    > idle3&
    > This will open up the Python editor IDLE in a graphical window.
    > scratch&
    > This will open up Scratch.
    > For further documentation on the ssh command just enter man ssh into the Terminal.
    > To configure your Pi to allow passwordless SSH access with a public/private key pair see the [passwordless SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) guide.
