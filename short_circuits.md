# Short Circuits

> After the first part delves into some boards, environments, simple coding exercises and tosses the reader into some immediate hacks, we need to take a step back and get into the basics of circuitry. Remember that the first part also introduces some basics on Electricity, the flow of electrons, the idea of a circuit, voltage and some tools used to work on circuits.



## Basic Circuitry

## Circuit elements (Big 3, semiconductor devices)
- Resistance, Capacitance, & Inductance
- How capacitors work
- How inductors work
- Semiconductor basics (Doping)
- Diodes
- Transistors
