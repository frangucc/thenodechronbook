THE FIRST CHAPTER
# Stealth Mode

> Each book we produce starts off with some history. In the first book, we take a look at Tesla and Turing. We then present a strong theme throughout the rest of the book on how these characters drive, innovations and politics impacted their lives. Moreover, we look at how like many inventors prior, they had to work in secrecy often and be wary of antagonists.

There is a great mix of the very basics of Electricity and Computing in this chapter.

**TODO**
* These should probably be 2 separate chapters!!!

Tesla part which leads to => AtoD, AC, Current, Electricity Basics
Politics show => greed, patent, investments, venture capital, protecting ideas

Turing part leads to FSM's and the real birth of CPU's, Microprocessing, all from the turing machine. Section also explores diversity, wining a war with brains not braun, etc.

**CHAPTER WORKING NOTES**

* We've illustrated some of the political history and higher level concepts of Tesla and Turing... But we need to ensure a cohesive, historical story is told.
* We also need a clear breakout and transition into the technology they created with a clear technical description, references and QR codes out to each. 
  * Section QR Codes should be about: AC-DC Tutorial, FSM Coding Example
* Axioms for Tesla section should include: Voltage, Electromagnetism, Vibration (other?)
* Axioms for Turing section should incldue: Microprocessors, CPU Design, FSMs

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTRO: **  Nicola Tesla, creator of the alternating current is muscled and destroyed by JP Morgan Jr (who's there to finish the job his father started).

> **PANEL ONE** - PULL BACK FROM PREVIOUS IMAGE AND SHOW THE IMAGE OF THE TESLA COIL THROUGH THE CORNEA OF NICOLA TESLAS EYE. NO DIALOGUE.

* **1 CAP:** If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.

> **PANEL TWO** - PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW NICOLA TESLAS FACE, WIDE EYED AS HE JUST WITNESSES WIRELESS ELECTRICITY WORKING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

* **2 TESLA:** ...free energy...
* **3 TESLA:** ...it works...

> **PANEL THREE** - PULL BACK EVEN FURTHER TO SHOW THE INFAMOUS TESLA COIL AND SPECTACULAR SHOW OF ELECTRICITY. YOUR CALL ON HOW TESLAS FULL FIGURE FITS INTO THIS PANEL.

* **4 TESLA:** ...this changes everything, again...


![](https://cl.ly/1b2M0p1m2Y2Q/tnc_5.jpg)


> **PANEL FOUR** - A STRONG KNOCK AT THE DOOR, SOMEONE IS THERE TO SHUT TESLA DOWN, AGAIN. HE HAD ALREADY HAD HIS TOWER OF DREAMS AND PATENTS SHUT DOWN AND STOLEN BY JP MORGAN.

* **5 POLICE:** Tesla, open the door, we know you're in there. You were told to cease and desist.

* **SOUND:** KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK

* **6 TESLA:** You're making a mistake. The world needs this. We will destroy our planet without it. 

> **PANEL FIVE** - THE DOOR IS KICKED IN AS A CREW OF POLICE RUSH THE OLD APARTMENT WHERE TESLA HAS BEEN TESTING HIS FREE WIRELESS ENERGY SYSTEM. BEHIND THE POLICE OFFICERS STANDS A MAN IN THE SHADOWS WHO IS PRESUMED TO BE JP MORGAN JR, WHO IS CONTROLLING THE COPS. JP IS WEARING A LONG COAT, TOP HAT, CANE AND HAS A SHINY GOLD POCKET WATCH.

* **SOUND:** CRAAAK--THUMPPPP

* **7 JP MORGAN:** I got you're letter. Did you think you could undermine my family? 

* **8 TESLA:** How could you, these are my ideas, electricity should be free, its not yours to control!

> **PANEL SIX** - TESLA IS LEFT CRUSHED, HIS IDEAS, STOLEN AND CRUSHED, HE HAS BEEN DEFEATED. SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR HIS TOWERS WERE DESTROYED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE JP MORGANS INSTRUCTIONS. THE COPS AND JP MORGAN HAVE RAIDED THE APARTMENT, DESTROYED EVERYTHING AND LEFT TESLA GRIEVING FOR HE KNOWS HE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO SUCCEED WITH FREE ENERGY.

* **9 TESLA, WHISPER:** The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine. 

* **10 CAP:** The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.

So if you'd someday like to be the one to discover the next new critical API or create the next scientific sensor with universal implications, you'll need to develop some basic instincts first.

**Segway to the Alan Turing section:**

![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dzryfxssm/image/upload/v1474384738/Turing_2_ug60dv.jpg)

Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behavior was still ****a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. 

Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning.

Alan Turing invented the turing machine to crack Nazi code generated by their infamous Enigma Machine. By deciphering encrypted messages captured over the air waves, Turing helped the opposition learn the Nazi's plans and positioning for attack. The turing machine would later become the premise of every modern computer. Finite State Machines are what interprets the binary system of all mainstream hardware and operating systems to this very day. He is considered one of the most significant inventors of the 20th century.

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTRO: ** Meanwhile, almost 40 years later, Alan Turing creates the Turing Machine which helps the opposition win the war against the Nazis. It becomes the premise of all modern computing. 

#### Turing PART 1

First part must talk about the turing machine and what he created and how he used it to defeat the Nazis.

| [The Turying Full Story in under 2 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDBJ7Mym3I) | 

#### Turing PART 2

Alan Turing was unjustly prosecuted in 1952 for what most people today do not regard as a criminal act.  Turing accepted an alternative, yet far more barbaric sentence rather than prison

> **PANEL ONE** - ALAN TURING IS BEING ABUSED IN AN INSANE ASYLUM, HE IS WEARING A STRAIGHT JACKED AND BEING TAKEN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE WILL BE CASTRATED (WE DON'T SAY CASTRATED IN THE DIALOGUE, BUT THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPEND TO THE INVENTOR OF THE MODERN DAY COMPUTER). HE IS FIRST SEEN THROUGH THE SMALL FACE PANEL OF THE DOOR FOR THE INSANE ASYLUM HE IS IN.

* **1 CAP:** We are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge.

* **2 WARDENS ASSISTANT:** Let's go Alan, it's your turn.

> **PANEL TWO** - THE WARDENS ASSISTANT RIPS THE MASK OFF HIS FACE.

* **3 ALAN:** No, please, you don't understand.

> **PANEL THREE** - A CLOSE UP OF THE WARDENS FACE AS HE SENTENCES ALAN TO HIS PUNISHMENT.

* **4 WARDEN:** It's quite the shame. Inventor of the modern computer, a queer.

> **PANEL FOUR** - A CLOSE UP ALAN TURINGS SWEET FACE. HE IS A NICE MAN, NEVER HURT ANYONE. HE IS FRIGHTENED AND HAS BEEN TREATED LIKE AN ANIMAL.

* **5 ALAN:** I'm a human being, you can't do this to me!!!

> **PANEL FIVE** - ALAN IS DRAGGED AWAY PAST MULTIPLE INSANE PEOPLE ON THE FLOORS, CHAINED TO WALLS LIKE CAGED ANIMALS. HE IS TAKEN FOR HIS PUNISHMENT.

* **6 ALAN:** Please, don't do this to me. It's not my fault!

* **7 CAP:** We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.

**ADDITIONAL HISTORICAL FIGURE CANDIDATES**

* John Bardeen
* Jack Kilby
* Add 2 females
* Add 2 males

*Each volume will reveal more about each of the historical figures*

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)

> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.


> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.


> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby (BSEE '47) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.

> 1890's - Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1891 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. 

> 1889 - General Electric organizes the first modern research-and-development laboratory. Edison begins work on a storage battery for use in electric cars.

*Revise this timeline to be more general and include the historical figures listed above*

**FIRST SPLASH PAGE**

This is still a work in progress - splash page should act as a second cover for the journey ahead. The intro chapter covers 2 important historical figures and then cuts to modern day, Gou and Non at the BHQ (The Basement Headquarters).

> Talk is cheap in the 21st century. You either got what it takes or you don't. Only the skilled will survive.

**IDEA #1: **Some collage of Tesla and the cops, the Warden and Turing and Non and Gou at the center of it all... Gou's father perhaps as well, who would appear to be their major antagonist, who later is revealed to be Gou's best resource and partner.
