THE FIRST CHAPTER
# STEALTH MODE

> **Chapter 1 (Stealth Mode) - **If we want to get into the lowest level of hacking and computing, we need to understand electricity, circuits, fields, forces and flows. Our main figure is Tesla here, as he was a huge thought leader in the area of energy, electricity, alternating current and more. We end this chapter with mention of John Bardeen and Jack Kilby of UoI who created the transistor and integrated circuit, which later would become the premise of modern PCB boards and chips. Our roots with Tesla however encourage EE's to think beyond such limitations, as some day computing will go beyond phsyical boards and move into nano and other forms. Tesla will help us understand the basics of electricity. Tesla's life was also interesting and had plenty of suspense, drama and turmoil. He is an excelent reminder of the historical role venture capital has played in innovation (and lack there of). We even make mention of Banzi and share a brief history of how the Arduino open source microcontroller has expanded our horizons even further.

Another description of chapter (*please merge*).

> **Chapter 1 (Stealth Mode) - **Tesla and the basics of electricity and circuitry with references to John Bardeen, Jack Kilby and Banzi. Experiments with the Arduino and blinking lights, electricity, voltage, measuring voltage, the very basics come together here while Gou fires up some basic breadboards and circuits. Energy! Theoretically, this chapter gives us a neat little intro to energy, voltage, electricity, basic circuits and some simple Arduino test projects that include resistors, conversion, capacitors, voltage, flow, current - very basic and simple circuit patters, gates, logic, fields, electromagnatism. We also disect an Arduino and get into the GPIO. You'll walk away with electrical engineering symbols, ability to read basic schematics and a really good understanding of fields, forces and flows. You'll finish with a higher level program, possibly in C or Python that ties together the stuff you learned into a program that can for loop across the electrical setup you've put together (possibly blinking led patterns or a motor project).



There is a great mix of the very basics of Electricity and Computing in this chapter. 

**MAJOR TODOS**

* Must tie together Tesla portion with Gou's portion and introduce the expiraments.
* Add several illustrations for Tesla that can bring the story full circle into the scientific Axiom Cards (place the cards)!
* Rethink the illustrations for GOU and the scenario in which he's exploring the basisc of electricity and electronics. 
* Decide what Arduino board UNO vs. Nano we will be using and what intro tutorials will best demonstrate the key concepts (elctromag, ac/dc, analog/digital,fields-forces-flows, voltage) - what expiraments can we do here?

## Screenplay overview, *non-technical*

This brings us to modern day and introduces us to Gou Sokyeo. We learn about his normal state, mindset, love for tech, family structure, environment, home and about some of the gadgets he produces. 


# MAIN SCRIPT B-SIDE

## *MAY NEED TO RETHINK THIS PART* SO IT TIES INTO ARDUINO EXPIRAMENTS AND PICKS UP WHERE TESLA LEFT OFF....

PRESENT DAY, PAGES 11-20

** THE NODE CHRONICLES INTERNAL INTRO: ** Gou and his brother Nōn are having a mixed conversation in their secret basement headquarters about their father, hacking and some of the cool stuff Gou's been setting up around the house. You get a sense for what sorts of projects Gou's working on and his relationship with his father and siblings.

What's more interesting in this chapter is that there's clearly a struggle and pressure. Gou is hiding what he's doing from his father, who when first depicted in the book appears to be an angry man. Almost as if a reincarnation of Tesla, only meaner and more badass. In the first chapter, Gou is caught with one of his hacking devices and his father snaps and rages, much like JP Morgan Jr. does in the first scene. 

While Tesla and Turing had to deal with much worse situations, it reminds us that even today, there is always conflict, there is always something or someone standing in your way. Gou's current conflict with his father (who somewhat even resembles Tesla) is a prelude to a much more dramatic situation towards the end of the book.

Eventually, Gou's father teams up with Gou after snapping out of his funk. This happens once the antagonist role is passed off to the greedy vulture capitalist duo (Brad and Eric) who try and steal Gou's invention using lawyers, shady dealings and politics. Gou's father has no choice at this point to shave, shape up and get in gear and represent the ultimate father and sons family business, something many fathers would love to have and share with their sons.

PAGE 11 & 12 [PROPERTY & BASEMENT INTRO]


![](https://cl.ly/3H2x0X10460z/NC_06_v2_72.jpg)

* **1 CAP:** Thus 'stealth mode' was their only option; Tesla, Turing and the hundreds of pioneers who came before Gou Sokeyo paid the ultimate sacrafices, their inventions forwarded and eventually, even their lives were lost. Human greed and lust for power will never change; there's always a snake in the grass waiting to strike. 

* **2 CAP:** For the two boys and their sister Lilu, why their father bought the old Frank Lloyd Wright house has and will always be a mystery. Vero their caretaker says it was a bad investment their father Chino made just before he cracked up and quit working. 

* **3 CAP:** Tucked away hidden down in the back of a prohibition era basement exists one of todays greatest young hackers. Frightened more than by any, his father hasn't the slightest clue what he's up to downstairs, for if he had, he would "KILL HIM."

> **PANEL ONE** - THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF REVEALING SHOTS GOING FROM FAR TO NEAR OF GOU AND NON IN THEIR HIGHLY SECRETIVE BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS. BEHIND THE STAIRCASE AND AROUND THE BEND OF THE LARGE BASEMENT ROOM, A WALL FILLED WITH STORED STUFF EMERGES. DOZES OF HUGE BOXES STACKED TO THE CEILING REVEALSE GLIMSES OF LIGHT FROM THE CRACKS WHERE THE EDGES OF EACH BOX MEET, RESEMBLING THE OUTLINE OF A DOOR BEHIND THE BOXES. THE BOYS HAVE MASKED AN ENTIRE WALL WITH A DOOR AS IF THE BASEMENT ENDED RIGHT THERE (THE LIGHT IS ONLY ON BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THERE WORKING). WHEN THE CORRECT BOX IS MOVED, A HOLE LEADS TO A DOOR, WHICH ONCE ENTERED OPENS UP INTO GOU'S SECRET BASEMENT HEADQUARTERS (BHQ). IT'S HOW THEY GET IN AND OUT. ONLY THE TWO BROTHERS AT THIS POINT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE. SEE REFERENCES OF WHAT THIS BASEMENT COULD LOOK LIKE BELOW.

![](https://cl.ly/1J221G2v2z2h/NC_06_72.jpg)

FRANK TODO: Add references to this scene about the green mill, al capones old hideouts, pathways to city hall - this interesting place could be the underground railroad in Chicago.

The general idea of the 10th and 11th page is that it's the opening to the setting. Zoom from afar to see the big home and what the landscape looks like. Zoom into see the ornate brickwork of the old politicians small mansion in Garfield Park. Get into the basement, which rumor has it was once connected to Al Capones underground railroad system and that you could get to city hall and the green mill from the basement tunnels. Just at the foot of the tunnel is the last room which is the only access to the tunnel. This is where Gou and Non have setup shop. The room is blocked off by a bunch of old boxes, Lily, Chino and Vero have no idea it's there. 

> **PANEL TWO** - CLOSER REVEAL OF THE TWO BOYS WORKING OUT OF GOU'S STEALTH MODE HEADQUARTERS...

![](https://cl.ly/2R2b351z2U2C/NC_08_72.jpg)

* **2 CAP:** Tis not without strife Gou secretly develops his innovations in stealth mode, for his father Chino does not want him to follow in his footsteps. [Add much more cleverness to this caption: As in the days of yester the top inventors, for whatever reasons, worked in stealth mode. Stuff about copycats, greedy companies and politicians are always searching for the next big thing and they lack their own creativity to invent them.]

> **PANEL THREE** - EVEN CLOSER... UNTIL WE GET RIGHT UP BEHIND THEM AND SEE WHAT GOU'S WORKSTATION AND SETUP LOOKS LIKE. OFF AND AROUND THE AREA ARE PALETS OF OLD PC'S COVERED IN TARPS AND STACKS OF OLD PC POWER SUPPLIES THAT GOU HAPPENS TO BE SALVAGING FOR SOME REASON. THE COMPUTER SCREENS HAVE GECKOBOARDS AND GOU IS CLEARLY MONITORING EVERYTING FROM LATEST BITCOIN STOCK PRICES TO SECURITY CAMERAS AROUND THE PROPERTY. YOU GET THE FEELING THAT IT'S THE START OF A CIA LIKE HEADQUARTER HACKER OPERATION AND THAT THERE IS A TON OF ROOM FOR EXPANSION.

* **3 CAP:** It's no secret that the worlds greatest inventors, from Davinici to Einstein kept their inventions a secret until they were ready. 

* **4 CAP:** By banning Gou from hacking on code and hardware, his father Chino had inadvertently created one of the youngest stealth mode hackers on the planet.

PAGE 13

> **PANEL ONE** - FULL PAGE PANEL. GOU IS FIXATED ON A HIGHLY EXPIRAMENTAL PROJECT WHICH HE DOESN'T QUITE SHARE WITH THE READER YET (SPOILER ALERT, IT'S THE NODE). GOU'S TAKING A HUGE RISK BY DOING THIS IN HIS BASEMENT, AS HE'S BEEN FORBIDDEN TO HACK ON COMPUTERS BY HIS FATHER. NON COULD GET IN TROUBLE JUST FOR BEING AROUND GOU IT'S THAT DANGEROUS. AND WHILE TOTALLY CHILL MOST OF THE TIME, YOU DON'T WANT TO PISS OFF CHINO, THEIR FATHER. IN THIS PANEL, WE SEE A CLOSEUP OF GOU'S FACE AND NODE.

* **1 CAP:** Swarn to be a normal boy and not to get caught up in computers and technology, Gou Sokyeo taught himself the art of electrical computer engineering against his fathers wishes. 


PAGE 14 [SHOWING OFF, GOU & NON FIRST DIALOGUE]

> **PANEL ONE** - FIRST EVER SCENE WITH GOU AND NON, THEY ARE INTRODUCED AS A PAIR, ONLY GOU IS CLEARLY THE LEAD HACKER IN THE FAMILY. NON'S JUGGLING A MINI SOCCER BALL (SIZE 1 FUTSAL BALL). AFTER ABOUT 60 JUGGLES HE SMASHES THE BALL WITH HIS RIGHT FOOT AND SMASHES AN OLD UNUSED MONITOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE IN. NEXT TO HIM IS ARE SEVERAL STACKS OF OLD POWER SUPPLIES THAT HAVE BEEN RIPPED OUT OF A BUNCH OF OLD PCS. THE PCS ARE IN ANOTHER HUGE PILE, COVERED UP BY A TARP, JUST IN CASE.

* **Sound:** Pap, pap, pap, pap

> **PANEL TWO** - A CLOSE UP OF NONS CAREFUL LOOK AS HE JUGGLES THE BALL COMFORTABLY ON HIS FOOT. PROPER FORM IS KEY TO THIS SHOT. 

* **Sound Continues:** Pap, pap, pap, pap, powwwww-boooot!!!

> **PANEL THREE** - NON GOES FROM A JUGGLE TO A VOLLEY KICK, SHOOTING THE BALL INTO A LINE DRIVE ACROSS THE ROOM THEY ARE IN AND NAILS AN OLD COMPUTER SCREEN AT WHAT LOOKS LIKE TO BE NONS DESK (WHICH HE NEVER USES).

* **1 Nōn:** 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, g-g-g-g-goooooallllllla-soooooo

> **PANEL FOUR** - NON DOES A CELEBRATION DANCE, THE RONALDO MOVE, AFTER HE SCORES - HE'S EXAGGERATING AND MAKING A BIG DEAL OF THE SILLY GOAL HE SCORES, AND ISN'T PHASED BY DAMAGING THE SCREEN. 

* **2 Gou:** Will you get outta here with that ball! I'm working!

> **PANEL FIVE** - GOU SHOUTS AT NON.

* **3 Nōn:** Hastag Anger Issues. What's dad got against us messing with technology anyhow? And why are you salvaging old PC power sources? 

``````

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ccluhu_XIAAcV29.jpg:large)

> **PANEL SIX** - GOU RESPONDS TO NON WITHOUT ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE DISTRACTED ANYMORE AS HE WORKS ON A PART OF THE NODE. HE RESPONDS TO NON VERY CASUALLY, AS IF BARELY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT NON HAS TO SAY. NON IS WEARING A SOCCER JERSEY AND IS CLEARLY MORE OF A JOCK, WHILE GOU IS DRESSED IN HIS BASEMENT HACKER OUTFIT (SEE CHAPTER WARDROBE NOTES BELOWS)

* **3 Gou** I dunno. I think he doesn't want us to grow up to fast... that and I think something happened to him in the industry just before he went on his sabbatical. And I'm replacing the coils with Rodin Coils. Testing something...

> **PANEL SEVEN** - NON STOPS BOUNCING THE BALL AS IF HE'S INTENTIONALLY LEFT IT ROLL AWAY AS HE FACES GOU. HE LOOKS CONCERNED AND NERVOUS FOR GOU AS HE TRIES TO WARN HIM. BUT GOU DOESN'T SEEM TO BE QUITE AS CONCERNED.

* **4 Nōn** You know if he catches you down here with all this stuff he's gonna kill you.

> **PANEL EIGHT** - GOU HOLDS UP THE HC-SRO4 SONAR SENSOR AND EXPLAINS TO NON THAT HE'S IMPLEMENTED HIS OWN SECURITY SYSTEM. GOU HOLDS UP THE SENSORS BEFORE NONS EYES BUT NONS NOT AMAZED, RATHER, HE'S SKETPICAL, AS IF TO SAY, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

* **5 Gou** I got eyes and ears on him all the time. You see this sonar sensor? If he even comes near the basement door upstairs I'll know. 

* **5.1 NOTE** Get the HC-SRO4 Ultrasonic sensor expansion pack online and setup your own security system like Gou. 

* **5.2 QR CODE** http://store.gamifyed.com/#/sonar-expansion-pack

* **6 CAP** Disguised as a normal thirteen year old boy, Gou is one of most elite ECE hackers in the world. From his secret basement headquarters in Garfield Park, he takes part in the most innovative programming and engineering projects known to man.

* **7 Nōn** The guys a couch potatoe.

> **PANEL TWO** - WE CUT TO A SCENE OF CHINO UPSTAIRS LAYING ON THE COUCH IN HIS ROBE. IT'S THE AFTERNOON AND HE CLEARLY HAS NO AMBITION. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO THIS PANEL TBD.

## Screenplay overview, *technical portion*

The main goal of this chapter is to get the reader to understand the major boards he uses and how to boot them, get to terminals, install some packages, navigate linux a bit and get their basic tools in order.

Tutorials need to be dumbed down and extremely DSL/Object/Verb oriented - almost as if a new way of writing tutorials. This is my conceptual way of writing them. 

Maps and visualizations of these steps are key. We must become the BEST in the world at tutorializing steps like this.... 

# MAIN SCRIPT C-SIDE (kilby + bardeen? outro?)

Gou needs to conduct his first electrical tests here. If we need to bust out an arduino at this point we can. 

Basically, we can't start with that other scene - needs to tie together what tesla was doing with modern day go - stealth mode + electricity tests, basic pings, voltage, energy, capcitators, elctromagnatism. 

#***MAJOR NEEDS HERE!!!!***

*Each volume will reveal more about each of the historical figures*

Time-line A Highlights: [See Full UOI Timeline](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/about/history/#1800)

> 2014 - Associate Professor Gabriel Popescu uses [white-light diffraction tomography](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v8/n3/images_article/nphoton.2013.350-f4.jpg) to capture 3-D images of cells with no dyes. This means the cells remain alive, allowing researchers to study them in three dimensions over time. As a result, researchers can observe how cells respond to specific drugs or treatments.


> 1972 - Electrical engineering and physics Professor [John Bardeen receives](http://www.famousinventors.org/images/john-bardeen.jpg) his second Nobel Prize in physics, this time for co-developing the theory of superconductivity with J. Robert Schrieffer and Leon Cooper. Bardeen had won his first Nobel in 1956 for co-inventing the transistor.


> 1958 - UOI ECE alumnus Jack Kilby (BSEE '47) invents the [integrated circuit](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Kilby_solid_circuit.jpg) while working at Texas Instruments in Dallas.

> 1890's - Tesla invented electric oscillators, meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer known as the Tesla coil. He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations of radio communication two years before Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1891 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara Falls, creating the first modern power station. 

> 1889 - General Electric organizes the first modern research-and-development laboratory. Edison begins work on a storage battery for use in electric cars.

**TODO**
* These should probably be 2 separate chapters!!!

Tesla part which leads to => AtoD, AC, Current, Electricity Basics
Politics show => greed, patent, investments, venture capital, protecting ideas


**RANDOM NOTES**

* We've illustrated some of the political history and higher level concepts of Tesla and Turing... But we need to ensure a cohesive, historical story is told.
* We also need a clear breakout and transition into the technology they created with a clear technical description, references and QR codes out to each. 
  * Section QR Codes should be about: AC-DC Tutorial Example
* Axioms for Tesla section should include: Voltage, Electromagnetism, Vibration (other?)
