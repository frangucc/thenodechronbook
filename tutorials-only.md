# Installing Noobs & Raspbian OS

When you first boot up NOOBS, you’ll get a selection of OSes to choose from. Which operating systems are available depends on which model of Raspberry Pi you are using. For this guide, we’ll stick to the most common OSesoperating systems available on the newest models of the Raspberry Pi. Right now, that’s [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/), [OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/), [Windows IoT Core](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot), [RISC OS](https://www.riscosopen.org/).

Which one to in stall depends on you. For now, we'll start with noobs, and that's good, cuz you're a noob.

when you open the pi, insert the SD card that comes with it and follow the instructions on the screen.
